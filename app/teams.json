"Description":"Project Logi-col[i]: Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL)",
"Abstract":"Two major hurdles facing the development of complex genetic logic circuits are device connectibility and device extensibility.  Connectibility refers to the ability to connect the output of one device to the input of another device, while extensibility refers to the dual abilities to rationally design new devices and combine multiple devices in one organism.  Our project uses terminator/attenuator (T/A) hairpin sequences (gates) to control transcription and anti-sense RNA as input/output signals to/from the devices.  We call this approach Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL – pronounced “taw-ssel”).  It solves the connectibility problems of common protein-based approaches because the anti-sense output of one device is used to disrupt formation of T/A hairpin structures of downstream devices, thus activating them.  In addition, because RNA secondary structures can be rationally designed (using our m-fold derived analysis program) we can readily construct a large family of devices with minimal cross-talk for inclusion in a single cell"

"Abstract":"Every year over 1.2 million people suffer myocardial infarction.  The resulting heart damage requires new approaches for effective repair.  Stem cell therapies provide hope.  However none of the stem cell therapies currently in clinical trials addresses the need  for efficient stem cell targeting to cardiac tissue or the need to replace efficiently dead tissue with new cardiomyocytes.  To address these problems, we have built several genetic circuits that work sequentially to repair the heart.  First, we have built an inducible differentiation circuit that closely resembles the endogenous differentiation pathway, to program cells to become cardiomyocytes.  Second, we have built circuits that use the extracellular domains of chimeric proteins to target cells to damaged cardiac tissue. Upon binding, novel receptor-coupled intein-mediated signaling domains activate effector genes that then aid in integration, inhibition of cell death, and the alteration of the tissue microenvironment"

All construction projects require the manipulation of varying size components, many much larger than any individual. To make this  possible, teams of individuals work together towards a common goal. To find out how to transfer this behaviour to our ``Bacto-Builders<i>, we investigate the possibility of using large numbers of E. coli to  perform a task too great for any individual cell. Specifically, this involves the physical movement of particles through direct contact with a swarm of bacteria working together in a co-ordinated manner.  The ultimate goal is to engineer the bacteria to follow a set of simple rules, so that collective behaviour emerges, and particles are assembled  into a desired pattern. Furthermore, patterns or structures  could be evolved in real time with bacteria adapting to new dynamic requirements or autonomously forming new structures.</i"

Our task is to design an effective as well as intelligent PCBs degrader. According to the recent research, ortho-chlorinated PCB metabolites (DHBs) are potent and physiologically significant inhibitors of DHBD, so we design a feedback activation pathway to increase the BphC transcription and expression under a 2, 3-DHBP and 4-CB inducible promoter Ppcb. As dihydrodiols and dihydroxybiphenyls are very toxic to bacterial even after short incubation time, we design a feedback repression pathway use sRNA components— sodB and rhyB. As to the sensor part, dihydroxylated PCBs are substrate of the clcA-encoded chlorocatechol dioxygenase and thus induce the clcR and related promoter, so we use this as the sensing system. T7 amplification system is added to the downstream to amplify the signal.  "

Core elements of the genetic memory are two mutually regulated promoters, designed as independent operator sites flanking a constitutive promoter. Thus, promoter transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed.

We have designed a modular genetic circuit to limit the expression level of a gene of interest to a user-defined, tunable threshold.  The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.

In addition, our third population of E. coli (termed Champion cell) acts as a biosensor by receiving these signal inputs and subsequently initiating transcription of specific E. coli-targeted bacteriocins (i.e. colicins) in tandem with specific fluorescent proteins. The presence of AI-1 induces the Champion to produce a colicin to which Bad guy #1 is susceptible, but to which Bad guy #2 is resistant, and vice-versa for AI-2."

Although different quorum sensing species have slightly different signaling molecules, these molecules are not completely specific to their hosts and cross-species reactivity is observed.

Firstly, biologically produced plastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are superior to petroleum-based plastics because they are both biodegradable and biocompatible. By focusing on modulating the ratio of two PHA monomers, 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate, the copolymer poly(3HB-co-4HB) can be created featuring increased elasticity and utility over any particular PHA monomer. Secondly, a novel polyethylene-degradation pathway is being engineered based on the oxidation of long-chain alkanes by alkane monooxygenase LadA. The region inhibiting the binding and catalysis of polyethylene has been computationally identified and site-directed mutagenesis is being conducted at this region to yield a mutant of LadA that oxidizes polyethylene and thereby increases its biodegradability. The combination of the production of an eco-friendly bioplastic with the degradation of petroleum-based plastics is a promising method of waste reduction"

Furthermore, developmental studies have highlighted the importance of gradient formation  and cell-cell communication for the generation of cellular patterns in the early stages of life. It has been shown that simple networks can form both static and dynamic patterns. Nonetheless, a system whose pattern formation is dependent on combinations of multiple signals has yet to be demonstrated. Here we address this question by designing a network, involving two different quorum-sensing based signaling mechanisms. Upon introduction in E.coli, the system can sense the relative amounts of two input molecules. Using a pre-define set of rules which was selected on its ability to generate spatial patterns, the cell can then express its final state by emitting red or green fluorescence and transmit its state to its neighbors."

Additionally, one of the main complications when implementing genetic circuits is possible cross-talk with endogenous pathways. Thus, an organism carrying a minimal genome would provide a simple chassis for biological engineering. Our approach is based on an iterative cycle of genome reduction and strain selection. We propose a novel method to randomly delete chromosomal fragments by controlled expression of restriction enzymes and ligases in vivo. Furthermore we develop a chemostat-based selective condition for cells having a smaller genome by constraining nucleotide availability.

The final objective is to express the extent of RcnA's repression (and so the extracellular nickel concentration) as a function of AHL present in the cell"

"Description":"Ligase-Independent Cloning as a Standard for BioBrick Preparation",
"Abstract":"While there is an established BioBrick format, there is not yet a standard method for turning a gene of interest into a BioBrick.  Ideally, such a standard method would be easily adopted, even by amateurs, and would lend itself to automation.  A significant drawback of several existing techniques is their dependence on ligase treatment, which is often problematic.  We propose a ligase-independent cloning (LIC) method, based on the technique of Aslanidis &amp; de Jong (1990), as a possible standard for novel BioBrick preparation.  Instead of short overhangs and ligase treatment, LIC uses long overhangs to circularize plasmid vectors for transformation without the use of ligase.  The LIC method reduces the number of enzyme steps required for cloning, thus lending itself to easy adoption, automation, and real biological 'engineering."

As a result, a huge proportion of the earth's biomass resources are trapped in a highly degradation resistant lignin matrix.

This work complements other gene expression control methods that focus on initiation of transcription. The desired result is quantitative control of transcript levels, which is often necessary to balance flux through a synthetic metabolic pathway. To demonstrate its potential for real-world application, the team is planning to employ this approach to control the expression of a heterologous pathway in E. coli for the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable polyester plastic"

"Description":"Bacterial device for creating and production of interactors for any given bait protein",
"Abstract":"We have developed a system allowing to search for antibodies with new specificities or screen protein libraries in order to generate interactors for a given bait. Our system changes a protein sequence to maximize its interaction with a given partner. Proteins with modified sequences are then directed to the bacterial outer membrane, where the best interactors are selected. Protein presented on the cell surface is fused with part of β-lactamase protein, while its bait is fused with the complementing part of the enzyme and added to medium. The stronger the interaction between proteins of interest, the more efficient the binding of the two halves of  β-lactamase, leading to resistance to ampicillin and survival. Cells expressing less interacting variants die as they don't achieve sufficient complementation of the reporter enzyme. This allows us to select strains producing interactors for any given bait"

The gene for the protein of interest will be located in a plasmid lacking recognition sites for the endonuclease, allowing it to remain intact after genome degradation.

Team Wisconsin used Escherichia coli to produce biofuel precursors in an effort to find these alternative fuel sources. One project focused on using E. coli to efficiently produce sorbitol, a biofuel precursor. Using computer modeling, we determined a way to funnel glycolysis’ intermediates towards the production of sorbitol via sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Wisconsin’s second aim was to isolate high-energy precursors from the plant cell wall through E. coli mediated breakdown of cell wall lignin. This was achieved by inserting the gene encoding lignin peroxidase , found in the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, into genetically modified E. coli, capable of producing and exporting the enzyme. Both projects improve current methods in the production of alternative fuels via two different, unique routes, and have the potential to move sustainable biofuel research forward"

Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity.

OMVs carry outer membrane, periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, DNA, RNA and other biological molecules. They protect their cargo from the extracellular environment and deliver it to a multitude of target cells via membrane fusion. We investigate the possibility of allowing the secretion of any protein in OMVs via fusion with novel, non-toxic partners enhanced in OMVs, using a novel Bioscaffold compatible with the current assembly standard.

Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase.

This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA.

A similar system can be used to “lock” the function of a gene of interest, like a combination lock, which is unlocked only when the cultures are grown in a pre-determined order of selection pressures. In principle, using this locking system, multiple plasmids can be maintained using a single selection pressure."

"Abstract":"The Illinois iGEM team has been working to engineer a decoder function within E. coli.  Decoders are logic devices used frequently in low-level computer architecture. We are creating a 2 to 4 decoder, which takes two binary inputs to activate one of four outputs.  Each output corresponds to a specific combination of the inputs.  With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein.  If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed.  This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars).  To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors.  The system allows the next engineer to swap standard parts in and out to change the inputs and outputs.  Our Bacterial Decoder can help sense for multiple environmental cues, having implications for medical diagnostics and environmental and water contaminant detection"

Our goal is to show that spatio-temporal structures can be generated by the behavior of a genetic regulatory network. We implement the model by means of several biobricks. We construct a self activating module and correspondingly an inhibitory one.  Self-activation dynamics is given by the las operon, while the inhibitory part is provided by the lux operon. Quorum sensing and diffusion of AHL provide the reaction-diffusion mechanism responsible for the formation of Turing patterns. The importance of our work relies on the fact that we show that the  action of the morphogenes as originally proposed by Turing is equivalent to the effect of  diffusion of chemicals interacting with the synthetic network, which accounts for the reactive part, a possibility implicit in Turing’s original work in the context of  morphogenesis of biological patterns"

The other one, “Cells in Cells” is the project to make a cell.  We defined making cells as making liposomes that can divide like mitochondria do.  To approach our goal, we set two subgoals.

From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation.

Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems&nbsp;: Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and  membrane penetration.  The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications"

This set of rules is called a grammar. A grammar tells us how to order words in a meaningful way.

We propose in our project a biological model which is based on this con- cept of language parsing from computational linguistics"

Today, the Martian environment is severe for any life to inhabit because of some constrained conditions. For instances, the surface temperature having a range from -80℃ to 15℃, CO2 occupying 95% of the atmosphere and the absence of organic substances on the surface don't allow aerobic organisms or heterotrophic bacteria to grow. Our project objective is to create a genetically engineered iron-oxidizing bacteria surviving on Mars and to establish a new model organism playing an important role to terraform Mars. We engineered Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans by introducing a synthetic pathway of both Melanin and Anti Freeze Protein with temperature-regulated systems. Anti Freeze Protein contributes to enhance tolerance of cryogenic condition and Melanin to blacken the Martian surface eventually resulting in melt of ice cap and generation of atmosphere and sea."

We created a green light-activated actuator to respond to external light signals, as well as a riboregulator-based signal counter to count the number of flashes. In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin. ESCAPES helps you “escape” from tedious protein preparation steps, such as centrifugation and cell disruption."

Coding sequences  of pyruvate-decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII (adhB), essential in alcoholic fermentation pathway, were designed by DNA chemical synthesis and codon-optimized for E. coli. The final circuit includes the device to metabolize lactose and the ethanol-producing operon, containing pdc and adhB. It has a theoretical yield of 20kilos/tons of whey.

"Abstract":"Photosynthetic light harvesting antennas function to collect light and transfer energy to a reaction center for photochemistry. Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization. "

Two enzymes, glycine/sarcosine methyltransferase, and sarcosine/dimethyglycine methyltransferase, catalyze three successive methylations of glycine for de novo synthesis of glycine betaine.  Here, we demonstrate an engineered E. coli with an increased growth rate under salt induced stress.  We highlight utility by demonstrating the improved growth of fuel producing bacteria in ocean water"

"Description":" The AyeSwitch: a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch in yeast",
"Abstract":"A novel genetic toggle switch regulated at the translational level was engineered in yeast that allowed the mutually exclusive expression of either green or cyan fluorescent protein. Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters.  The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour.  These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems"

So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core.

On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes.

We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm.  In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein.  To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation.

This year, iGEM CHIBA is constructing genetic double-click system whose output is released only when the input (inducing agent) is given twice within a limited time. To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd ‘confirmation’ input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs.

The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family.

In our project, we explored the possibility of harnessing a biological system as an alternative solution for data en/decryption and storage.  By using E. coli, we engineered and devised a prototype, dubbed E. cryptor, for 1) bio-encryption and -decryption with error checking; and 2) data storage in a bacterial system.  In the age of synthetic biology, designed microorganisms may carry a specific DNA barcode to be distinguished from their natural counterparts.  Our system could turn such barcode into more than simply a tag.  In the future, can we also store text, pictures, and even videos into these tiny bacteria and protect the contents"

In order to be able to control the level of expression in this system, we plan to develop a regulatory system(s) that simulates a logical AND gate in response to two bioloical inputs. We plan to use the decreasing pH during curdling and the addition of nicin as the two inputs. To achieve the AND gate we will be using the CRE gene in combination with loxP sites.

Synthetic biology offers great opportunity for biosensors, however current designs require hours before useful output. To tackle this issue in the field, it's crucial that our project can respond in minutes, hence we have engineered a fast, modular sensor framework. This allows detection of a range of different parasites, and may also be used as an environmental tool for mapping their spread. We have developed two new technologies that enable our modular input/output - a novel cell surface biosensor, customisable for specific parasitic proteases, linked through quorum-sensing to a new 'fast-response' module capable of producing a detectable output in minutes. To demonstrate the concept, we've designed and fabricated B. subtilis to give a striking colour readout upon detecting the waterborne Schistosoma parasite which affects 200 million people worldwide"

Past iGEM projects have used chemical or optical stimuli to actuate transcriptional responses. Our project, however, seeks to add voltage sensitivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Baker’s yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters.

The aryl acylamidase converts a colorless acetaminophen(Tylenol TM) to a brown color substrate. Since the detecting E. coli has three heavy metal promoters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the E. coli emit mixed fluorescence, so we simultaneously detect metals.

Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments, formed by engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration.  The complex will then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation.  By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds.

The polymerase has furthermore been mutated in such a way to avoid interactions with nucleic acids, thus diminishing the effects it may have in the bacterial host cell. This system can be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag attached to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research nor treatment."

"Abstract":"When generating flow through a microcapillary tube, engineers are met with problems in generating force and keeping fluids mixed or separated. Inspired by an article by Kim et al on bacterial carpets that could generate flow, we have designed a biological system in E. coli that can induce flow and increase mixing in a fluid, essentially working as a microscopic flow actuator. The actuator uses E. coli’s flagellas and can be switched on and off using light. Our system is composed of several novel parts: a photosensor, that controls the tumbling frequency of E. coli’s flagella via chemical pathways; a hyperflagellation part, to increase the number of flagella and the power of the system; a retinal producing part, that works with the 2009 Cambridge’s iGEM team’s β-Carotene brick, which we have helped further characterize.

Vibrio cholera was chosen as a test-case, giving us two potential routes to engineer E.coli to recognise the pathogen: 1. Fusion of cholera’s receptor (CqsS) for its quorum sensing molecule (CAI-1) with the internal apparatus of one of E.coli’s general stress detecting systems (BarA). 2. Engineer the whole cholera quorum sensing system into E.coli.Each of these would then be connected to a representation system (GFP or E.chromi) to visualize the pathogen"

"Abstract":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease in which joint matrix is degraded and chondrocytes undergo disordered and hypertrophic differentiation, symptoms including joint pain, tenderness and stiffness. We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: \"Detector\", \"Actuator\" and \"Supervisor\". As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects"

E. coli engineered to express CqsA could grow along with regular gut flora and render V. cholerae avirulent by maintaining high CAI-1 concentrations. To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++.

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter"

However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons.  These ‘tailings’ are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs.  Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system"

Cells containing synthetic DNA constructs that produce fluorescent proteins in the presence of AHLs could be used as in situ reporters of the AHL milleu in dynamic natural systems like biofilms and plant root nodulation. Additionally, cells that can produce AHLs could be used to alter the signalling in these systems and examine the results. Finally, different combinations and spacial arrangements of AHL inducible reporters, AHL producing cells and AHL degrading cells all regulated by the AHL milleu of the media could allow for information processing through the interactions between such nodes. Out team designed a number of AHL regulated nodes, devices that each respond to AHL levels in different ways, and attempted to build some of these nodes to characterize their behavior"

"Description":" Quorum Sensing Amplifiers and a Codesign Approach for Information Processing",
"Abstract":"Synthetic biology endeavors to create information processing systems modeled on digital electronics.  The use of quorum sensing can help transform an inherently analog molecular signal into a binary response and simultaneously allow the tuning of input response thresholds and signal amplification.  This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling.  Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function.   In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits.  Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains.  We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor.  A unique aspect of our project is the collaborative nature involving five institutions at three locations"

The protocol relies on the “Best Match” method developed in response to the limitations of other screening protocols previously proposed by trade organizations. The objective of the “Best Match” method is to identify sequences which are uniquely related to Select Agents or Toxins. The GenoTHREAT software is being developed in accordance with the Government guidance and, to our knowledge, is the first implementation of the sequence screening procedure outlined in the guidance. Although software characterization has elucidated both strengths and limitations, GenoTHREAT appears to be a viable tool for sequence screening"

It's based on E. coli strain expressing invasion determinants: invasin from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement"

Our first project targets Bacillus anthracis, the Gram-positive pathogen that causes anthrax.  We re-engineered an enzyme to remove the pathogen's protective coating, rendering it defenseless against the immune system.  In our second project, we re-engineered and transplanted a protein secretion system capable of combating Gram-negative bacteria into E. coli.  This system was designed to target Gram-negative pathogens in a modular and controllable fashion.

Using sensitivity tuners the system can be designed such that the response will occur at an exact level, when the size of the population poses a threat to the host.

The chassis for this system is the common probiotic in yoghurt, Lactobacillus acidophilus. Once the Lactobacillus acidophilus has reached the duodenum, they will lyse by either by a timed inducible/repressible system, a bile-inducible system, or an encryption system. Using DNA we can mimic the functionality of a combination lock, and produce a \"locked\" gene, which can be effectively \"unlocked\" only after a specific sequence of inputs. Since DNA functions as a logical medium, the \"locked\" and \"unlocked\" states are heritable, which makes this system useful as the computational basis for many higher-order genetic devices from bacterial calculators to engineering of new metabolic pathways to bacterial drug delivery systems."

Lactobacilli are the predominant commensal organisms in the human vaginal mucosa and are ideally placed to detect the presence of a sexually transmitted infection, such as Human Papillomavirus. A strain of this bacterium has been modified to produce a chromogenic reporter, which is visible to the naked eye, when ‘switched on’ through exposure to the input signal (viral infection). However, in order for this to be clearly visible in vivo, this signal needs to be transmitted throughout the entire bacterial population.

Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible.

By replacing the periplasmic domain of ToxR with existing or engineered ligand-dependent homodimers, we hope to link ToxR dimerization (and gene expression) to the presence of specific ligands. Initially, ToxR constructs proved to be toxic to E. coli. To address ToxR toxicity, we screened microarray data for promoters that exhibited stress-based down regulation. We constructed a negative feedback system with the rffGH promoter, which permits the use of potentially toxic proteins like our various ToxR chimeras.

The fusion protein engineered to contain a fragment of the OmpA membrane domain and a zinc finger domain allows the protein to be expressed on the outside of the cell while remaining bound to the host cell. Possible applications of this project include creating patterns with fluorescently labeled cells or studying cell-cell interactions"

"Abstract":"In the bodies of people with diabetes, the ability to recognize and respond to glucose concentrations in the blood has been compromised. As a result, glucose accumulates to dangerous levels. High blood glucose concentrations can cause irreversible damage to critical organs, impairing their functionality. With parts from the iGEM registry, our team created a glucose-controlled promoter linked to a yellow fluorescence production gene in E. coli. The concentrations of glucose to which the promoter responds can be determined. Once the concentration is known, the promoter can be mutated so that it will be activated by varying concentrations of glucose and be used as a glucose sensor for people with diabetes. In the future, an insulin gene could be added to this system for use in insulin pumps, where specific glucose levels trigger insulin production in E. coli"

"Abstract":"Current medical practices are only able to scratch the surface of tissue engineering or organ development. Fortunately, nature has provided us with robust, cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems, we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits, allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues"

"Abstract":"Traditional methods for obtaining biofuels have relied on the fermentation of agricultural crops. The problems are reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels.  This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source.  It will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications"

Currently, the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. Our goal is to create a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa.  Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes. Quorum sensing elements from P. aeruginosa were transplanted into E. coli and used to express detectable reporters. We are thus creating a novel biosensor capable of detecting the presence of P.

For this reason, last year’s Panama team designed a BioBrick that can biosynthesize rhamnolipids under the presence of rhamnose and β-hydroxyalkanoic acids. Rhamnolipids have emulsifying properties that reduces the surface tension of water, making the hydrocarbons easier to recover and biodegrade. This year we want to create a BioBrick that provides rhamnose for rhamnolipid biosynthesis and for other purposes as well. We also want to create a bioremediation system using existing biobricks that will produce the rhamnolipid while biodegrading the hydrocarbons in vivo.

Using luminescent proteins and optogenetic tools, we constructed “Sender” and “Receiver” HEK 293T cells which send and receive blue light, respectively. The Sender Cell expresses a 480nm light emitting protein. The Receiver Cell expresses Channelrhodopsin-2, an ion channel gated by 480nm light. When the Receiver Cell is illuminated, Channelrhodopsin-2 opens, triggering a second luminescent protein via calcium influx. Since the luciferases in this system require an externally added luciferin substrate, we have also been developing Pre-coelenterazine, a genetically encoded luciferin which could allow our system to function autonomously.

Since nowadays we are exposed to continuously stress, perhaps we can avoid the negative effects caused by this condition. Thus, a mechanism that counteracts this imbalance is highly desirable. The ability of some bacteria to sense stress hormones such as Catecholamines will be used to produce Interleukin-12 and inducing Th1 lineage. On the other hand, the ability to sense Nitric-Oxide released in inflammatory conditions will be used to trigger Interleukin-10 production, counteracting excessive immunity.

With the development of the dairy industry in China, yogurt has become highly accepted by consumers, including those lactose intolerance people. And postacidification has always been the most vital factor which affects the shelf life and flavor of yogurt. So our team takes it as our track. Through the literature, we have discovered a gene, called lacR, which could combine with the lactose operon to inhibit the production of lactic acid in Bulgaria Lactobacillus. If lacR could be highly transcripted in Bulgaria Lactobacillus when the pH value of yogurt declines to a certain level, the acidification of yogurt would be postponed. Meanwhile, we also want to transfer part of human collagen genes to Streptococcus Thermophilus in order to enhance the nutrition of yogurt"

"Abstract":"In eukaryotes, heterochromatin plays an important role in gene regulation. Here we use a synthetic biology approach to imitate heterochromatin in E.coli to achieve gene silencing. Specifically, fusion proteins comprising tetR and different parts of HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein) were synthesized, they are expected to bind DNA specifically and carry out polymerization among the fusion HNS and the native HNS to create a densely packed DNA form, which may block the transcription. We produced constructs with tetO sites upstream or downstream of lac promoter and EGFP gene. Then we used standard constitutive promoters with different activity to drive our fusion proteins to find the optimum expression level. Moreover, tetR, HNS and fusion proteins were purified and gel shift assay was utilized to detect the interaction between those proteins with DNA. This study presents a novel approach to introduce a mimic heterochromatin-like structure into prokaryotes to achieve inducible gene silencing."

"Abstract":"Adding to the already massive arsenal of bacteria, highly-resistant (HR) /E. coli/ are found to be capable of supporting less-resistant (LR) individuals experiencing antibiotic stress through indole signalling - allowing LR individuals to survive in antibiotic concentrations that would otherwise be lethal. Our team has engineered disruptor /E. coli/ expressing mutated toluene-4-monooxygenase, which facilitates indole degradation. Introducing this disruptor strain into an /E. coli/ culture of HR and LR individuals is thus hypothesized to result in massive LR cell death at a lower-than-expected antibiotic concentration. If successful, indole degradation may become a possible strategy in boosting antibiotics effectiveness in medical practices against bacteria relying on similar signalling methods. We are also constructing a novel strain of /E. coli/ that utilizes an essential gene (/nadE/) for antibiotic-free transformation and plasmid maintenance. This strain can help future iGEM teams reduce their antibiotics consumption without deviating significantly from widely used transformation protocols."

"Abstract":"We have developed a series of devices which program a bacteria population to maintain at different cell densities. A genetic circuit has been designed and characterized to establish a bacterial ‘population-control’ device in E. coli based on the well-known quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri, which autonomously regulates the density of an E. coli population. The cell density is influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. We have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by site-directed mutagenesis of a luxR promoter (lux pR) and error-prone PCR of gene luxR, and we are building a database for a series of mutation sites corresponding to different cell densities and fluorescent intensities. An artificial neural network will be built to model and predict the cell density of an E. coli population. This work can serve as a foundation for future advances involving fermentation industry and information processing"

"Description":" Rainbofilm",
"Abstract":"Rainbofilm is a stratified expression system in biofilm, a self-organized module extensible for various needs. Researchers found a vertical oxygen gradient establishes in the biofilm. Such property allows us to use oxygen sensitive promoters to artificially induce differentiated functions through the spatial distribution of cells. Thus, the multi-step reaction can be processed within the different layers of the biofilm. The biofilm and its layered structure form spontaneously. Also biofilm has the natural resistance to high levels of toxin. These two properties render the Rainbofilm a convenient stable system for bio-production and bio-sensor. The system can cater to different needs simply by changing downstream genes. One possible application is ethanol production. The cellulose is degraded to monose from the bottom to the middle layer, and the ethanol is produced and secreted in the surface to minimize the toxicity to the inner cells"

"Abstract":"Escherichia coli's optimal growth temperature is 37°C. Its growth rate decreases drastically at lower temperatures and growth completely halts below 7°C. The aim of our project is to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. Therefore, expressing these proteins will likely enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37°C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7°C, possibly even allowing growth near 0°C. Our project is fundamental in its nature, but any application outside the labs, from biofuel production to bio-sensors, will benefit from the ability of icE.coli to grow at low temperatures, since this will relieve the burden and costs of maintaining the temperature constant at 37°C. Moreover, we envision a temperature-based selection as an alternative to antibiotics-based selection"

NHRs bear high homology to each other and are modular into distinct regions: N-terminal regulatory region, DNA-binding domain, a Hinge region, Ligand binding domain (LBD) and a C-terminal region. Some Nematode NHRs can be activated by extracted oil contamination of the soil so they can use as possible oil sensors in the future. Zinc finger motifs are the tools of NHRs to bind DNA and regulate gene expression directly. These tiny elements can be tested as direct gene regulators.

We observed a statistically significant reduction in fluorescence during growth compared to cultures with IPTG-inhibited LacI, demonstrating lacI production by rrnB P1.

"Abstract":"The synbiome project exploits synthetic biology to obtain a synthetic stable community of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Two different bacterial strains ‘A’, ‘B’ and one eukaryotic cell type ‘C’ will be engineered to establish mutualism: ‘A’ produces a N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) sensed by ‘B’, which in turn produces a different AHL sensed by ‘A’. In addition, both bacterial cells activate,  through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell ‘C’ responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin. The creation of a consortium of inter-dependent cells from different kingdoms is expected to pave the way to multiple applications, since different cells might cooperate and, for instance, better produce complex molecules"

"Abstract":"Regulation of gene expression by light-sensing is a milestone in synthetic biology. In this project we strive to upgrade the existing coliroid system by making it triple-chromatic. Our triple-chromatic coliroid system employs sensors for red light, green light and blue light in one and same platform. These sensors are to be activated both independently and together. This functions as a triple-switch of genetic regulation. In combination of switching the individual sensors on-and-off, one can achieve higher dimensions of transcriptional control. The proof of concept is shown by coupling each type of sensor with chromoproteins, proteins that naturally show color when expressed. Instead of visualization by e.g. UV light, our colidroid system can be visualized with naked eye. Other than a bacterial piece of art, our system will be very useful in the future concerning e.g. biomaterial."

Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl.

In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce.

The first construct would allow for extracellular secretion of Aspergillus phytase from Arabidopsis roots allowing the plants to utilize the accumulated forms of soil organic phosphorus (primarily, phytate), which otherwise would not be available to the plant. The second construct, building on Yale’s 2011 project, aims to increase the range of tolerance to low temperature stress in A.thaliana by incorporating a Rhagium inquisitor antifreeze protein and ensuring it is constitutively expressed in the plant"

"Abstract":"S. cerevisiae (yeast) is a commonly used organism in food preparation processes around the world.  This fungi naturally produces Vitamin D2 - which is less potent in terms of biological benefit for humans than D3.  In the past, Yeast has been modified to increase production of D2 but no attempt on converting it for D3 production has been made.  Our team aims to insert the necessary genes to allow for simultaneous D2 and D3 synthesis when the modified Yeast is exposed to Ultraviolet light.  If successful, this new strain of Yeast could provide an extremely cheap and efficient alternative to current Vitamin D supplementation.   "

"Description":" Genetically Modifying Methanococcus maripaludis into an Air Freshener Producer",
"Abstract":"The methane-producing archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis was synthetically modified via expression of a gene to produce geraniol synthase (GS) from Ocimum basilicum. The GS gene was cloned on a methanococcal shuttle vector downstream of a strong promoter, and transformation of methanococci was confirmed via PCR.  GS catalyzes the conversion of geranyl diphosphate, an intermediate in biosynthesis of the isoprenoid lipids of these archaea, to geraniol, the major aromatic compound in roses and a potential biofuel. Small amounts of geraniol biosynthesis were detected in cultures of the transformants by GC/MS.  Methanogens are archaea that live in the guts of humans and animals and are responsible for the methane content of flatulence.  Thus, this project could convert personal polluters into an air freshener.  Because of the prevalence of flatulence among the aging population of the United States, the potential impact of this research is very high."

Therefore, a modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways"

"Abstract":"Whooping cough, the infectious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, is diagnosed in tens of millions of people and results in almost 300,000 deaths globally each year. Low-income and unvaccinated individuals as well as infants are especially susceptible. Current diagnostic procedures are complicated, costly, and can take up to a week, by which time the disease may have progressed or spread. The enormous impact of this disease urgently motivates the development of a faster, cheaper, and more reliable diagnostic test. Our epidemiology models suggest that earlier diagnosis could drastically reduce the incidence and impact of the disease. We propose an engineered bacteriophage diagnostic system for rapid clinical detection of pertussis. We first engineered T7 bacteriophage to demonstrate this approach in E. coli. Our modular diagnostic approach can be applied to the high-sensitivity detection of other bacteria"

This system couples the translation of the target gene to a fluorescent reporter gene. Fluorescence will only be detected when the target gene is entirely translated. This construct enables synthetic biologists to quickly determine if a gene is being expressed without the need for costly antibodies or analytical instruments (e.g. mass spectrometry).

To demonstrate this system we developed the SAVE Assay, which uses visual cues to indicate the overall quantity and relative percentage of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes amongst differentiated stem cells. The assay uses a dual plasmid system that selects for successfully transformed stem cells via neomycin and puromycin resistance along with fluorescent reporter genes regulated by atrial and ventricular promoters.

Colour gradients were achieved using a high-copy plasmid that contained both an inducible colour gene and its corresponding repressor. Colour banding was achieved by a novel means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control that varied from 0 to ~1000 copies/cell as a function of inducer concentration.

Our method of bacterial detection fills a niche in biosensor technology. Our design implies lower costs, higher portability, and a more rapid signal output than most bacterial biosensors. Additionally, our interchangeable DNA probe confers modularity, allowing for a range of bacterial detection.

We have developed a novel detection and bioremediation strategy for caffeine contamination by refactoring the methylxanthine degradation operon native to Pseudomonas putida CBB5. Escherichia coli cells with this synthetic operon degrade caffeine by N-demethylation to the guanine precursor, xanthine. Cells deficient in guanine biosynthesis and containing our refactored operon were addicted to caffeine; their growth density was limited by the availability of caffeine. Remarkably, they were able to sense the caffeine content of several common beverages. Characterization of nearby genes in the P. putida operon revealed a potential methylxanthine regulatory system for use in biological circuit design. The synthetic N-demethylation operon could be useful for cheaply producing pharmaceuticals or precursor molecules and for detoxifying waste so that it can be recycled into animal feed and biofuels"

We have developed a strategy that enables high-throughput library screening with microscopy by coupling a unique fluorescence signature with each genotype present in a library. These MiCodes (microscopy barcodes) are generated by targeting combinations of fluorophores to several organelles within yeast, and they eliminate the need to isolate and observe clonal populations separately. MiCodes can potentially scale to library sizes of 10^6 or more, and their analysis can be largely automated using existing image processing software. As a proof of principle, we applied MiCodes to the problem of finding unique pairs of protein-protein interaction parts"

The ability to make many orthogonal buffer amps is critical to scaling up digital information processing in vivo. For our project, we first provide two mathematical proofs: (1) the buffer amp is 'equivalent' to a bistable circuit, in that the ability to create one implies the ability to create the other, and (2) inhibitors with first-order binding cannot allow bistability (without other elements). This means that methods such as TALORs and many sRNA strategies cannot build a buffer amp. Thus, we test a new method: sequence-specific formation of a DNA-DNA-RNA triple helix to block a promoter. By using a dimer for the RNA, we can achieve second-order binding, allowing us to build sequence-specific buffer amps"

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created"

"Abstract":"For this year's iGEM competition we create a programmable time switch in yeast(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) employing the counting mechanism of telemere. The time switch we made counts the replication number of a single yeast cell, and triggers the activation of a certain gene (death gene, for example) when the replication number of the cell reaches the pre-set level. The work is an attempt to use the special quality of telemere and the end of chromosomes in the construction of synthetic biology device. Our system utilizes a whole new mechanism that is seldom used in cell counting device, and it enables us to delay the expression of a certain gene for generations. And by control the life span of a certain cell, it sheds new light on the biosafety concerns and can be used for fields such as the protection of intellectual property rights"

When coupled with heme oxygenase, these bacteriophytochromes are supplied with biliverdin, a pigment which allows for the self-assembly of a switch within the host system. In the presence of red light, the conformation of the bacteriophytochrome is modified. This reaction produces a visible colour change in the presence of red light, and can be used to control expression of a targeted gene when coupled with the appropriate response regulator. Exposure to far-red light will cause the bacteriophytochrome to revert to its original conformation, thus repressing the gene and reversing the colour change. "

This year, in Japan, the detection of formaldehyde in Tone river became an issue. (1) We planned to create E.coli with an ability to&#12288;detect and detoxify formaldehyde named Chef Ant E.coli. About detection, we try to visualize formaldehyde by ligating regulated promoter, frmR and GFP. Moreover we plan to overexpress two enzymes in Chef Ant E.coli. First, formaldehyde dehydrogenase decomposes formaldehyde to formic acid. The gene of formaldehyde dehydrogenase is from Pseudomonas Putida. Second, formic acid dehydrogenase converts formic acid to CO2 and H2O. The gene of formic acid dehydrogenase is from Methylbacterium extorquens"

"Abstract":"We created an E. coli for long distance communication. This “Communicheria coli” was inspired by the Pony Express, a rapid mail delivery service in the American Wild West, where mail was relayed by horseback riders. Communicheria coli sends a message, in the form of light, to distant cells, which then relay the message to other distant cells.  Communicheria coli has light sensors constructed using the light receptor domain of bacterial sensory rhodopsin or the cyanobacterial green light sensor CcaS. In response to light signals, cells will induce their own lux operon to send the message to other distant cells, for example in a separate flask, which will in turn relay the message to other distant cells.  To improve the effectiveness of our new signal delivery system, we set out to enhance the light intensity, change the light color, and shorten the response time.   "

To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature.

When functional genes are placed downstream of these promoters appropriately, the two devices are supposed to degrade fatty acids and convert glucose into cellulose rapidly, thus preventing excessive calorie intake as well as producing prebiotics. Meanwhile, the third device was designed to control the densities of “E. coslim” and forestall horizontal gene transfer in future applications.

The yeast strain used contains a yeast/human chimeric G-subunit, enabling coupling of the LH/CG-receptor with the pheromone pathway in yeast. Binding of hCG should consequently result in activation of the pathway. The genes tnaA and fmo, encoding tryptophanase and flavin-containing monooxygenase respectively, were introduced into the yeast strain. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to indigo. tnaA was set under the control of the pheromone induced FIG1 promoter and fmo was expressed constitutively. Hence, detection of hCG should result in the production of bio-indigo, the output signal of the biosensor.

We fused UVR-8 with the DNA binding domain from TetR, which is unable to dimerize and to bind DNA in monomeric form. UV-exposure might force the TetR-UVR8 fusion dimer to split, release the DNA and enable transcription. Thus, TetR-UVR8 might act as a light-activated on-switch in bacteria. We plan to use this novel switch to start the production of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), a common ingredient of sunscreen, and - dependent on the intensity and duration of exposure as determined by our detailed in silico model - a colored pigment as a visible warning signal.

Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemicals such as biocides, whose long term health effects remains to be elucidated, there is a great need for innovating solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects.    To reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer a bacterial 'torpedo' capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments, pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating, or the establishment of a protective biofilm produced by the torpedo bacteria"

"Abstract":"The vertebrate immune system produces billions of different antibodies. This diversity is generated by random VDJ-recombination of a limited number of antibody subfragments. This inspired us to construct an automatic recombination system in E. coli that generates large numbers of novel proteins by combinatorial fusion of functional domains.    The site-specific DNA recombinase Gin of bacteriophage Mu depends on the presence of a DNA enhancer element for efficient recombination. This allowed us to construct a system, called “The Recombinator”, which automatically shuts down after successful recombination. We visualized the randomizing function of our genetically engineered slot machine by combining colors with cellular localization domains.    By scaling up the number of recombination modules and functional domains our system will be able to generate a multitude of new proteins. We envision that “The Recombinator” will serve as a tool to create novel enzymatic activities for innovative drug design, environmental detoxification and metabolic engineering"

"Abstract":"Imagine a world in which all sectors of industry use synthetic biology to meet specific needs. The NRP-UEA team have developed novel biobricks, which provide a foundation for a system with this level of complexity. The project began with a simple idea with widespread applications: the detection of exogenous nitric oxide (NO). However it soon became clear the detection of highly reactive NO was challenging, and this was addressed in two main ways. A bacterial promoter, PyeaR, was fused to its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The functionality of this flexible dual promoter was determined in both mammalian and bacterial chassis. Yet it was determined that further specificity was still needed, leading to the comparator circuit, that subtracts the expression of one promoter from that of another, allowing for signal integration and quantitative computing.  This system thus allows for the detection of any chemical, providing the promoters have overlapping specificity. "

Our approach for solving this problem has been to develop a genetic circuit that makes E.coli cells able to release toxic molecules only when in presence of cancer cells.  As cancer cells grow faster than healthy cells, they also consume more oxygen and release more lactate than a healthy cell would do, so to make the E.coli cells recognize cancer cells we have made a system where the input signals are high lactate concentration and low oxygen concentration. When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively.  With our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology"

Strategies developed to address this problem provide varying levels of containment, however, the substantial elimination of HGT remains difficult or perhaps impossible.    We have developed a new containment system to expand the range of environments where GEOs can be used safely. To do so, we rely on three levels of containment: physical containment with alginate capsules, semantic containment using an amber suppressor system, and an improved killswitch featuring delayed population-level suicide through complete genome degradation.

"Abstract":"Obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammatory response, which among other things, is triggered by bacterial plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  A high-energy diet, increases the amount of LPS-producing gut microbiota, and increased LPS levels has been observed in obese individuals. By inducing changes in the gut microbiota by prebiotics, like inulin, it is possible to decrease the plasma LPS level. This is associated with the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth. We have designed a novel approach to address this issue of plasma LPS, by probioticly induce changes in the gut flora by genetically modifying a bacteria to produce plant originated inulin. We cloned the two genes encoding sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST) and fructose:fructose fructosyltransferase (FFT) from the Jerusalem artichoke into a E. coli, where it will produce inulin by using sucrose as an acceptor molecules.

In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product.

The functionality of peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1 for use on the C-terminus of gene products is also analyzed. Difficulties in designing laboratory protocols and engineering genetic constructs are approached by developing a multi-purpose software tool to solve methodological obstacles, as well as facilitating implementation of a modular design on future projects"

"Abstract":"One of the major environmental problems in northeastern Mexico is arsenic contamination of groundwater. Several projects have previously aimed to biorremediate heavy metals and metalloids using bacteria, but without scalable potential due to the lack of an efficient cell recovery system.    We aim to develop an easy-to-recover arsenic biosensor and chelator. Recovery strategy will consist of a new adhesion mechanism that enables bacteria to bind to silica surfaces through the expression of the L2 ribosomal protein, attached to the outer membrane protein AIDA-I. A quantifiable, highly-sensitive luciferase-based reporter system coupled to an oligomeric metallothionein is expected to increase our system’s capability of arsenic sensing and chelation"

"Abstract":"Synchronization of biological processes in populations is essential to achieve strong measurable and functional traits. Circadian rhythms are one of nature's most exquisite mechanisms to regulate and synchronize biological processes over time. Our team has taken advantage of the fine time control offered by the circadian clock machinery to construct a genetic circuit that allows robust oscillatory behavior in a synchronized and predictable manner. We have coupled the expression of genes of a bioluminescent pathway to the endogenous circadian clock of Synechocystis PCC 6803. The benefits of using Synechocystis as our chassis for practical applications include minimal production costs due to its autotrophic growth capacity and precise synchronization to time-dependent events using environmental cues such as light. As a direct application we designed the first self-rechargeable programmable bio-lamp. Secondary projects include a novel secretion system, the first spider-silk biobrick and an optimization of the Gibson assembly reaction for small parts"

"Abstract":"The composition of B-POM is that hrpR's promoter depends on the input, but hrpS’promoter is always Ptet and tet owns PhrpL, while the output gene follows tet and shares PhrpL. Once the input is sensed, the input promoter triggers hrpR's transcription. The activity of Ptet is constitutive, which means HrpS protein is ample. As HrpR accumulates, HrpS binds to HrpR and form HrpRS which then triggers PhrpL, and tetR and output begin to accumulate. tetR can inhibit Ptet. As a feedback, HrpS and HrpRS will decrease. PhrpL will be of lower activity, so the amount of tetR  and the level of output will decline. The decrease of tetR will enhance the hrpS' expression. All these construct a feedback cycle. Finally, the output will stabilize and be in a certain proportion with the input. By manipulating the RBS of hrpR, hrpS, tetR and output gene, we can control input-output proportion."

Quorum sensing is a type of bacterial cell-cell communication correlates with the population size. Many bacteria have one or several species-specific quorum sensing molecules released in different growth state and environment. Quorum sensing signals are shown to be involved in many physiological functions, including virulence, biofilm formation and drug-resistance. We aim to establish a novel bacterial identification method in clinical samples based on the quorum sensing profiles"

"Abstract":"During winter season, due to low temperatures, fish farming is one of the most heavily affected economic venues. Due to this, year after year, several farmers are faced with many problems as a result of a loss of fish product.  &lt;/p&gt;Using our background in bioengineering we suggest an innovative alternative: Our idea is based on heterologues expression of SrUCP in <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> and <em>Rhodotorula glutinis</em>. Through the expression plasmid, yeasts are transformed from the wild-type phenotype into a thermogenic phenotype.  &lt;/p&gt;To implement this idea and make it simple and efficient, we plan to drive the expression of SrUCP under the control of cold shock promoter Tir1. In this way, yeasts will generate heat only when the temperatures drop. Moreover, the temperature-responsive range of Tir1 may be regulated by applying genetic circuits, providing the means to manipulate the biological device to suit different temperature conditions and needs in application"

Bee. coli is strategically designed to work as follows. First, it continuously secretes mannosidase to inhibit the sprouting of N. ceranae spores. Second, if the bee is infected, the fungus-killing-circuit with a positive feedback design will be turned on to wipe out N. ceranae. Third, if these designer weapons should fail to conquer N. ceranae, our designed bee-suicide-operon will be activated to kill the infected bee and save its companions. Fourth, a light-inducible lysis system is included to ensure our Bee. coli only lives inside of the bee. Fifth, we apply encapsulation as the way to send Bee. coli into the bee. Since the capsule will only dissolve in a bee’s gut, our Bee. coli will not spread to the environment"

Noting the abundant genomic data of prokaryotes from aromatics-rich environment, Peking iGEM applied part mining to the genetic repertoire to develop a comprehensive set of biosensors for aromatics. The transcriptional regulators for each typical class of aromatic compounds were bioinformatically determined and promoter engineering and protein engineering were performed to tune their function. To expand the detection range, enzymes in upper pathways, working as plug-ins, were coupled with biosensors to degrade aromatics to detectable compounds. For environmental detection, we construct the band pass filter to detect a certain range of concentration. Responses of biosensors equipped with band-pass filter can robustly reflect the concentration of environmental samples. Peking iGEM has remarkably enriched the library of biosensors for aromatics and enabled quantitative detection for environmental monitoring.

This response is usually regulated by positive or negative feedbacks by using inducer or repressor proteins.

To design an artificial fast responding oscillating circuit, we designed an&#12288;RNA-based oscillator. We used RNA-responsive self-cleavage ribozymes whose cleavage is regulated by an RNA molecule. The ribozyme cleavage cuts-off an “RNA scaffold” that harbors RNA aptamers. This aptamer binds to its specific target proteins, which are directly fused to reporter protein. This binding recruits the already translated split reporter protein complementation resulting in the output (twinkles). Our system enabled fast response and short oscillation cycle. "

The dimerized proteins have enzymatic activity that can be detected via commercial test strips. The device will also sequester the proteins and allow us to clear them. In order to efficiently detect and clear a small molecule called atrazine, which is an herbicide causing tremendous environmental problems, we split our aptamer-based detection module and clear module into two strains. The first strain is chemotaxic to atrazine and will release quorum sensing molecules to attract the second strain, which contains atrazine hydrolase to clear it"

Our choice of bacteria  Nissle 1917,  a probiotic strain of Escherichia Coli, once inside the body will secrete a cancer tracing protein which recognizes and builds up around the cancer cells. Using the quorum sensing system, E.coli Nissle 1917 detects the bacteria inducing substance AI-2 produced by the tracing proteins. Nissle 1917 bacteria motion towards the region of AI-2 and once in the region, produce our cancer killing protein called apoptin. Apoptin enters the cancer cells and induces apoptosis thereby eliminating their existence"

The bacterium is found in warm water environments, particularly in artificial water supply systems such as air conditioning systems and cooling towers. The enfection occures by inhalation by small droplets of contaminated water. Our aim, as the team “Baskent_Meds”, is developing bacteria which can recognize Legionella pneumophila specifically at species level by legionella quorum sensing, and respond  by producing anti-Legionella peptide which is produced by some Staphylococcus strains. Quarum means “minimum”. Legionella pneumophila should sense the minimum amount of cells around to colonize in the environment and express its virulence. So our modified E. coli may sense the presence of Legionella pneumophila in any contaminated surface and kill it"

As their effect on the environment is unknown, they pose a potential threat. In order to eliminate this threat, we are developing a genetic circuit, using e. coli as a model GMO, that limits the lifetime of a bacterial population after it is released to the environment. Our goal is to allow the end user to program a GMO population to survive in the environment until it has completed its task, after which the entire population will disappear without any further external intervention.  We employ two approaches to achieve this goal: One relies on the dilution of a synthetic control element through cell division, and the second is based on the lifetime of an essential protein containing an unnatural amino acid."

Inducers are synthesized by different synthases (LuxI, LasI or RhlI) that are each expressed in one strain and subsequently secreted into the medium. Once taken up by a cell, the inducers bind to the corresponding, inactive transcription factors to render them functional.

While fertilizer is a requirement for modern life, runoff from over-fertilized farmland can cause eutrophication.  In the presence of abundant ammonia, algae overgrow and consume much of the available oxygen in the water.  This results in decreased biodiversity throughout the watershed.  Within Europe, 53% of lakes are eutrophic.     Using two E. coli mutants built with genes from Nitrosomonas europaea and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we provide a system to reverse nitrogen fixation.  Our mutants consume ammonia and produce nitrous oxide, and release a sustainable source of energy when decomposed into nitrogen and oxygen.

Mines secrete the signaling molecule N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (OHHL) whereas non-mines process the signal. To distinguish between OHHL-levels, a library of PLuxR promoters with various sensitivities was created through site-saturation mutagenesis. High-pass filters were constructed to control the expression of different orthogonal hydrolases in non-mines, depending on the number of surrounding mines. Additionally, the mines express their own hydrolase. A spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model was established to evaluate and improve the system. To play Colisweeper, a colorless substrate solution is pipetted onto a colony of choice.

L-forms are thought to exist naturally within plant tissues and we also studied their use as agents for delivering novel functionality into plants. For project outreach, we created a game as an Android application and considered the implications raised by our project and also look at the exciting relationship between synthetic biology and architecture.

"Description":" Developing Biosensors to Identify Antimycin-Producing Actinomycetes",
"Abstract":"Antimycins, anti-fungal compounds primarily produced by Streptomyces (a sub-set of actinomycetes), function by inhibiting the final stage of the electron transport chain. Our aim is to develop Biosensors to aid identification of novel antimycin-producing actinomycetes. Homologues of the AntA sigma factor, the key regulatory protein in antimycin biosynthesis, are present in all 14 known biosynthetic gene clusters. Due to this property, Biosensors have been designed with the AntA-regulated promoter (antGp) controlling the expression of three reporters: neomycin resistance gene, RFP (red fluorescent protein) and GUS (providing &#946;-glucoronidase activity). The Biosensors will be produced, trialled and optimised where possible after sub-cloning into two actinomycete-specific integrative plasmids, pMS82 (BT1 integrase) and pAU3-45 (C31 integrase). Worldwide soil and sediment samples have been collected to produce a library of actinomycete strains, which will be screened using our Biosensors, the ultimate goal being to screen bacterial strains for antimycin production"

"Abstract":"PCBs (Polychlorobiphenyls) are synthetic chemicals widely used during the late 20th century. These compounds are extraordinarily stable, not readily biodegradable and have accumulated in the environment. PCBs also accumulate in animal fatty tissues including human tissues. As PCBs are probably carcinogenic and some are endocrine disruptors, they constitute an important health issue.   Although PCBs have no natural equivalents, some bacterial communities have developed the capacity to degrade PCBs. Highly chlorinated PCBs undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination, lowering the chlorine atom number. Lightly chlorinated PCBs are then degraded via the aerobic biphenyl degradation pathway.   Our project is to construct an Escherichia coli strain capable of degrading PCBs by introducing in the strain genes involved in PCB degradation in various bacteria. Because some steps are anaerobic and others aerobic, we want to use an oxygen-based regulation of gene expression. We also want to develop a sensor system to detect PCBs in the environment."

Our project aims to make an E. coli strain able to produce natural rubber while grown under controlled conditions. Natural rubber is composed of polymerized IPP (isopentenyl pyrophoshate) units. E. coli already possesses the ability to produce IPP, but it lacks the polymerization enzyme, prenyltransferase, from the rubber tree.

"Abstract":"Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus causes major problems, especially in hospitals, leading to over half a million infections annually in the US alone. Of the alternative treatments currently under investigation one of the more promising is through antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These small, highly-specific peptides attack the membrane of target organisms. Thousands of AMPs are known to exist and little resistance against them has been developed.   The Peptidor project consists of an E. coli that can detect S. aureus, using S. aureus’ native quorum sensing system, in order to locally produce and deliver AMPs.  Upon detection, peptides inactivated by a SUMO-tag fusion, are overexpressed. After a delay period, introduced through a negative transcriptional cascade, a SUMO protease is expressed cleaving off the inactivating tag. Using this mechanism, high concentrations of peptide are delivered at the infection to efficiently kill S. aureus.  As a safety mechanism, the timer also activates an E. coli kill-switch. "

Antibiotics, hormones and various noxious substances threaten environmental health and are not effectively removed by conventional waste water treatment. We propose to employ transgenic plants which produce effectors for enzymatic degradation (BioDegradation) or specific binding (BioAccumulation) of pollutants. The autotrophic, sedentary, aquatic nature of the moss Physcomitrella patens makes it an ideal chassis for a self-renewing, low-maintenance and cheap water filter. A light-triggered kill switch prevents unintended environmental spreading by limiting viability to places where the spectrum of sun light is appropriately filtered. Furthermore, we have developed a device to implement this biological filter in an aquatic environment, investigated the application of this new technology and examined its economic feasibility. Based on our results, PhyscoFilter may become a game-changing approach to improve global water quality in an affordable and sustainable fashion."

The binding of those hormones to progestogen receptors can mistime the reproductive behavior of aquatic organisms and thereby endanger population balance.  Our aim is to construct a yeast-based measurement system for progestin concentration in water samples. Many currently used methods are either very expensive or significantly slower than our method will be. We take advantage of membrane bound receptors in order to achieve high specificity and to speed up measurement.  The binding of the ligand to the receptor stops inhibition of the reporter and thereby initiates its expression through a sensitive signaling-chain. This transcriptional switch allows measurement of very small amounts of substrate. To improve our system we use different interchangeable parts for assembly to get a high variety of possible applications.     "

This includes engineering large synthetic pathways and improving their expression. Overexpression of genes has hitherto mainly been achieved by using high or medium copy plasmids. However, studies have demonstrated that plasmid-bearing cells lose their productivity fairly quickly as a result of genetic instability. Therefore a new method was developed for the overexpression of a gene of interest in the bacterial chromosome: Chemically Inducible Chromosomal evolution (CIChE). In this technique the chromosome is evolved to contain a higher number of gene copies by adding a chemical inducer. The original model for CIChE, however, results in bacterial strains containing a large number of antibiotic resistance genes. To make this valuable technique more widely applicable in the industry, we developed a model for chromosomal evolution based on a toxin-antitoxin system instead of antibiotic resistance"

Everything is housed in a vending machine-like enclosure that regulates fruit ripening in response to consumer demand. Ethylene is a natural plant hormone that is widely used to ripen fruit, such as bananas and kiwi. However, the synthesis, handling, and storage of ethylene is expensive and dangerous. In contrast, B. fruity produces ethylene from inexpensive material by exploiting a TCA cycle intermediate, 2-oxoglutarate, and the activity of P. syringae 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase. The inhibition of fruit ripening results from the synthesis of MeSA via a pathway built with wintergreen parts.

"Abstract":"Cancer kills eight million people each year, a number unchanged over the past five decades. The current paradigm for cancer treatment involves non-specific therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation that cannot differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissue. We propose a novel vaccine delivery system of tumor associated antigens and immunomodular agents encapsulated within probiotic bacteria to harness the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. The bacterial vaccine should activate macrophages and dendritic cells in order to teach the immune system to recognize cell surface antigens that distinguish tumors from healthy tissue. We aim to engineer lab-strain Escherichia coli and E. coli Nissle 1917, a commercial probiotic, to train the immune system to target and destroy tumor cells. This provides a distinct advantage over current bacterial vaccinology platforms, which rely on pathogenic bacterial chassis such as Salmonella and Listeria.  "

"Abstract":"The world consumes over 40 million kilograms of indigo annually, primarily for dyeing denim. Indigo is currently derived from petroleum using a high energy process, and commercial dyeing involves the use of reducing agents to solubilize the dye. The development of biosynthetic and bioprocessing methodologies for indigo dyeing could have environmental and economic advantages. By combining the biosynthesis of indigo and the use of the natural indigo precursor indican, we propose a more sustainable dyeing method as an alternative to chemically-reduced indigo in the large scale production of indigo textiles. We achieved in vivo indigo production in high titers, and efficient cleavage of indican using a non-native glucosidase. Inspired by natural systems, we isolated and characterized several plant and bacterial glucosyl transferases hypothesized to produce indican. Lastly, we compare the cost and environmental impact of our alternative with the present chemical process."

The next-generation of strains could be “programmable,” with on demand generation of molecules within a bioreactor e.g. a yogurt fermentation capable of making any combination of flavouring, nutrients or pharmaceuticals. While merging all this potential into single hosts seems efficient, it would also bring added risk in the case of a process failure due to bacteriophage infection. Here, we not only rationally design widespread immunity to phage infection, but also hack this immunity system to yield programmable biosynthesis at the community level. We demonstrate this by building both broadly and specifically neutralizing CRISPR systems that were paired with biosynthetic capabilities for vanillin, caffeine and cinnamaldehyde production. Eventually, a fermentative process could exist  that is vaccinated to phage infection but susceptible to targeted phage addition that results in a programmable probiotic – or ultrabiotic"

Current research is focused on finding new ways to use bacteriophage either in their wild-type state or after they have been modified for use in synthetic biology.   We studied two ways to modify existing well-characterized bacteriophages. First, we employed random mutagenesis, CsCl purification, and plaque-size selection to isolate T4 and T7 bacteriophage with altered capsid sizes. A library of capsid sizes will allow researchers to select the appropriate bacteriophage for use in biotechnology or nanotechnology applications.  Second, we designed a cholera sensing and destruction circuit using bacteriophage lambda.  In this circuit, lambda contains biofilm-degrading enzymes controlled by a cholera quorum-sensing system transferred to E. coli.  Upon sensing cholera, this E. coli will activate lambda, leading to cell lysis and biofilm degradation.

Our approach to antibiotic resistance is to engineer a temperate phage, Lambda, with light-activated production of superoxide. The fluorescent protein KillerRed was cloned into a plasmid vector and lambda gt11 with the IPTG inducible lac promoter. Lysogens were isolated and these strains were characterized and compared to E. coli with KillerRed from high-copy plasmids. Light activation of KillerRed resulted in decreased cell numbers. In addition, we modeled our system at multiple scales, including populations of phage and bacteria, KillerRed gene expression, ROS production, and effects of light. Having two methods of killing, lysis and superoxide, decreases the probability of developing resistance and our system overcomes the prior limitations of using wild-type temperate phages"

Our Universal Self-Amplified (USA) Biosensor uses a genetically modified detection bacteria to solve many of the aforementioned issues.

We address this goal by constructing a unique platform for interspecies-dependence based on inducible expression of a required histidine biosynthetic gene (HIS) in each species. Expression of the bacterial HIS gene is induced by lactic acid produced by constitutive expression of a lactate dehydrogenase gene in the eukaryote. Expression of the yeast HIS gene is induced by the binding of its mating factor receptor to mating factor expressed constitutively on the surface of the prokaryote. Histidine deprivation necessitates physical contact and symbiosis for survival. Such pressure may facilitate evolution of a stable exosymbiotic form of the two species.

However, current chemical methods for keratin degradation are energetically costly and previous efforts at keratinase production in heterologous hosts have been stymied by poor protease expression. To address both these problems, our team constructed BioBricks based on kerA, a serine keratinase gene native to B. licheniformis active on whole poultry feathers. We designed two biobricks for expression in E. coli and constructed a high copy number BioBrick plasmid with an origin of replication compatible with B. subtilis. By designing a new keratinase expression system in B. subtilis, we hope to provide a faster, cheaper alternative to current methods of industrial keratinase production"

"Description":" DiversiPhage: Library Generation for Protein Selection",
"Abstract":"Both the mammalian immune system’s complex defenses and a bacteriophage’s targeting mechanism depend upon protein diversification. These models have inspired innovations ranging from targeted drug delivery to protein display. Using the major tropism determining (MTD) protein expressed on the Bordatella bacteriophage BPP-1, we aim to develop an in vitro system for generating antibody-like proteins that bind specified targets. The MTD protein expressed at the phage’s tail fiber is naturally modified at its variable region to produce nearly 10e13 possible binding variants while preserving its structure. Mutating the MTD’s variable region by PCR can match the massive diversity of MTD in vitro. A library of MTD protein-DNA fusions generated by mRNA display can then be screened for binding against specified protein targets. This in vitro analog to phage display and immune clonal selection can be a powerful tool for constructing target-binding MTD variants with equally many varied applications.  "

"Abstract":"In microbial communities, bacterial populations are commonly controlled using indiscriminate, broad range antibiotics. There are few ways to target specific strains effectively without disrupting the entire microbiome and local environment. The goal of our project is to take advantage of a natural horizontal gene transfer mechanism in bacteria to precisely affect gene expression in selected strains.  We combine bacterial conjugation with CRISPRi, an RNAi-like repression system developed from bacteria,  to regulate gene expression in targeted strains within a complex microbial community. One possible application is to selectively repress pathogenic genes in a microbiome, leaving the community makeup unaffected. In addition, we use CRISPRi to lay the groundwork for transferring large circuits that enable complex functionality and decision-making in cells"

"Abstract":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death in the United States for over twenty years and is a rising global health issue. Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between CVD and atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries. One associated risk for atherosclerosis is the production of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by natural gut flora when metabolizing L-carnitine, a chemical found primarily in red meat and energy drinks.      We created a probiotic to attack the root of this problem by outcompeting the gut bacteria for L-carnitine in order to suppress the production of TMAO. L-carnitine transporters (caiX and cbcWV) and L-carnitine dehydrogenase (CDH) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in a safe strain of E. coli (Nissle 1917). This engineered E. coli can uptake and metabolize L-carnitine along an alternative, safe pathway into 3-dehydrocarnitine. Together, this system offers a novel solution in preventing TMAO-related cardiovascular health conditions"

To address this, uOttawa has engineered a network in S. cerevisiae that is responsive to fold-changes as opposed to absolute changes in stimulus. This allows the network to maintain sensitivity despite noise, and also permits response to stimuli in a much larger dynamic range. By modifying the promoter driving the stimulus, the network can be engineered to detect fold-changes of any molecule with a responsive promoter, thereby serving as a structural chassis for the next generation of molecule detectors.

Using dextranase, the E. coli are able to attach onto the dextran layer that S. mutans normally live on. This allows the E. coli to deliver a targeted dose of norspermidine, helping with the breakdown of S. mutans biofilms. We also took another approach that utilizes a natural quorum signaling molecule, competence stimulating peptide (CSP). This peptide is responsible for population control in S. mutans.

The lack of a chromosome renders minicells unable to replicate and cause infection, yet they still retain and express plasmid genes.  Furthermore, minicells inherit the stable, non-leaky membranes and cytosolic composition from their parent cell. Our project design is centered on the creation of an IPTG-inducible FtsZ Biobrick that permits tunable overexpression for optimal minicell production. With the development of a multi-purpose, innocuous bacterial chassis as our ultimate goal, we incorporated three additional safety elements: the Ail protein, a polysialic acid capsule and de-acylated lipopolysaccharide. Both Ail and the PSA capsule serve to prevent complement deposition on the surface of the minicells, with PSA also protecting against antibody opsonization. Finally, LPS toxicity is reduced by inducing minicell formation in an lpxM mutant strain that lacks a critical myristoyl transferase for late-stage acyl modifications"

Engineers seeking complex programmed population-level behavior require tools enabling controlled, information-rich intercellular messaging. Given its versatility and universality as an information-encoding molecule, DNA suggests itself as a message-carrying molecule to enable information-rich messaging. The Endy group at Stanford recently published a proof-of-principle demonstration of such DNA messaging wherein a DNA message was transmitted from one bacterial population to another carried by M13 bacteriophage particles. Here we propose an intercellular communication program that extends DNA messaging by controlling modification and transmission of a DNA message. Modification is controlled through flipping a DNA switch on the message DNA – a promoter sequence that is invertible using serine integrases and recombination directionality factors (RDFs). Transmission is controlled by placing expression of the M13 major coat protein, which is required for viral packaging of message DNA, under control of such a     switch"

The current chemical method of synthesizing PLA is expensive, and the required processing and purifying steps use many environmentally unfriendly chemicals. Recently, E. coli has been engineered to produce PLA, but low yields and short chain lengths prevent the approach’s commercial use. Here, we evaluate the potential of using multiplex automated genome engineering to raise both yields and chain lengths of biosynthesized PLA by directing the E. coli metabolism to funnel resources toward PLA production without sacrificing the organism’s viability. Efficient biosynthesis of PLA, which may be thus achieved, would be a significant step in reducing the impact of plastic waste, and would benefit those receiving bone implants.

Such ncAAs can grant new functionality, including photocrosslinking, photocaging, novel bonding or binding sites, and fluorescence. One part of our project creates an “Expansion Pack Reporter Kit”. This kit uses a fused fluorescent reporter, containing an N-terminal RFP domain, a C-terminal GFP domain, and an amber codon-containing linker sequence that connects the two domains. While the RFP domain is translated and fluoresces under all conditions, the GFP domain is only translated when the ncAA is incorporated within the linker.

"Abstract":"If BU can clone it, so can you! With a pinch of wet lab work and a dash of computational tools, we have developed a new recipe called Chimera that will help fellow synthetic biology cloners in the creation of their genetic devices! Chimera utilizes bio-design automation software tools with experimental protocols and builds upon a thoroughly characterized library of MoClo parts. This recipe, or workflow, integrates software tools to reduce human error and to structure the way device designs are chosen, assembled, and tested. To demonstrate that this workflow can be used by any level of cloner (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), we will highlight how we used Chimera to create [1] individual genetic parts (namely tandem promoters, fusion proteins, and different backbones), [2] transcriptional units assembled from individual parts (with both new and previously made MoClo parts), and [3] a complex genetic device (our goal is a priority encoder)."

"Abstract":"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which is characterized by alterations in kidney functions and structure, affects millions of people worldwide and a large portion of them is unaware of it. Absence of symptoms in early stages leads to a late diagnosis when patients need dialysis or even transplants. Currently, CKD is diagnosed by measuring creatinine levels in blood, which in turn are detectable only at late stages of renal dysfunction as well as are sensitive to factors such as diet, gender, ethnicity, age, muscle mass. We report the development of a biosensor that can diagnosis CKD in its early stages, identifying a biomarker named Cystatin C. Using a cell surface biosensor as detector and quorum-sensing system as transducer and response mechanism, we developed a genetic circuit that establishes a tthreshold, differentiating concentration ranges of Cystatin C. We envisioned it as a fast, simple and reliable tool for CKD screening and diagnosis."

"Abstract":"Milk cows and cattle are important factors in global warming: In their rumen, billions of microorganisms release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane as they help digest the animal’s food. Even though this is a natural process industrial-scale farming intensifies the situation. Therefore, finding ways to decrease production of such gases damaging to climate is essential. Considering the 25 times greater contribution to global warming compared to CO2, methane emission is a substantial point of action for future climate protection. In order to achieve this, we are going to engineer a bacterium in a way that it is able to render methane harmless just as it originates in the cow’s rumen. The bacterium shall be equipped with the 6 subunits of the monooxygenase (MMO) out of Methylococcus capsulatus turning methane into a natural intermediate of the cellular metabolism so that no methane is released into the atmosphere."

We furthered our work by developing a novel directed evolution apparatus that will provide us new tools in improving ore separation, thereby granting our technology versatility and adaptability for biomining.

BUGSS has built on this earlier work, developing a new Biobrick for Pfu DNA polymerase, which offers a replication error rate approximately 6 fold lower than that of Taq. The development of this Biobrick began with the amplification and cloning of the pol gene for Pfu DNA polymerase from contaminant DNA in a commercial stock enzyme.

Using the native sludge bacteria Nitrosospira multiformis and Nitrosomonas eutropha as chassis we inserted genes to produce erythromycin esterase B and β-lactamase to breakdown azythromycin and penicillin. We also inserted nirS, norB, norC, and nosZ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, as well as genes to produce dispersin, amylase, and AHL-lactonase to inhibit biofilm formation. To increase bacteriophage resistance, prophage in the Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas genomes were identified and used to build a guide RNA region for a Type II CRISPR system. By deleting the serA and serB genes we engineered serine auxotrophs to prevent release of our modified microbes. These improvements will help reduce antibiotic resistance, increase water reclamation, prevent algal blooms, and allow more biomass to be harvested."

To investigate the viability of independent, non-interfering cell-to-cell signaling, we attempted to implement non-endogenous bacterial quorum-sensing systems from various Gram positive bacteria in E. coli, in hopes that successful transfer of these systems into E. coli will promote enhanced prototyping of intercellular signaling and regulation in synthetic biology’s favorite model organism. To this end, three separate quorum sensing systems—agrBDCA, lamBDCA, and fsrABC—were investigated. We constructed various cell strains expressing separately the signaling and receiving components of the quorum sensing systems and measured their efficacy in creating and receiving the signaling molecule. Treatment of hormonal regulation disorders (e.g. diabetes, Cushing’s disease, etc.) is one of many possible applications of successful creation of circuits implementing intercellular regulation."

Estrogens from natural, synthetic, plant, and fungal sources show endocrine disrupting properties and even at low concentrations have harmful effects due to receptor activation. A sensor was constructed using the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. Estrogenic activity occurs in water sources including waste, drinking, and freshwater. In freshwater, estrogens are harmful to the ecosystems, feminizing fish and disrupting populations of organisms. Additionally, estrogenic substances can be present in what we drink. However, since the presence of hormones in water is a relatively new area of study there have been no previous restrictions or regulations regarding removal of estrogenic compounds.

Pollutants including lead, mercury, and nickel can enter water supplies through improper disposal of waste, industrial manufacturing, and mining. Previous researchers have developed biological methods of heavy metal sequestration utilizing heavy metal transport proteins and metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular weight proteins with high binding affinities for heavy metals. In these genetically engineered systems, the transport proteins will preferentially transport a specific heavy metal into the cell and the metallothionein will aggressively bind--driving flux into the cell and sequestering the toxic metal. Our research aims to modularize previous sequestration systems for nickel and mercury utilizing a yeast metallothionein/glutathione-s-transferase fusion protein as well the transport proteins NixA (nickel transporter) and merT/merP (mercury transporter). We also plan to extend this sequestration system using a putative lead transport protein."

In order to address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, new antibacterial agents are required. We have engineered a novel phage therapy utilizing the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes packaged into non-replicating phage. CRISPR-Cas9 systems target 20-32 nucleotide DNA sequences within the bacterial genome. Successful CRISPR targeting to the genome leads to a Cas9-mediated DNA double strand break and subsequent cell death. By cloning targeted CRISPR sequences into the endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 system and introducing this system into Escherichia coli by transformation or through phage infection, we have demonstrated sequence specific killing of bacteria in a heterogeneous bacterial population. The broad ranging applications of such an adaptable and cost effective antibiotic therapy range from healthcare to agriculture and represent the future of antibacterial research."

Mosaicoli aims at investigating emergence of complex patterns from a simple rule by engineering a cellular automaton into E. coli. This automaton comprises a grid of colonies on a 3D-printed millifuidic chip. Each colony is either in an ON or OFF state and updates its state by integrating signals from its neighbors according to a genetically pre-programmed logic rule. Complex patterns, like Sierpinski triangles, are visualized by fluorescence after several steps of row-wise propagation. The implementation of quorum sensing based sequential logic computation is challenged by leakiness and crosstalk present in biological systems. Mosaicoli overcomes these issues by exploiting multichannel orthogonal communication, riboregulators and integrase-based XOR logic gates. Successfully engineering such a reliable system not only enables a better understanding of emergent patterns, but also provides novel building blocks for biological computers."

Splicing is catalyzed by several base sequences at both ends of intron as a ribozyme, being subjected to nucleophilic attack from introns to exons. We would like to clone the two parts of intron to use this mechanism and cyclize mRNA, making plasmids which include a gene coding proteins between those. And, by transforming E.coli, we get world’s longest proteins."

"Description":"Switching on the power of E.coli: a customizable recombinase switch",
"Abstract":"A genetic recombinase switch provides irreversible, inheritable and inducible gene expression, which is of great value to the growing field of synthetic biology and iGEM in particular. We attempted to create a recombinase switch which would, in response to arabinose, switch from encoding a flagellar gene, to two genes that encode gas vesicle formation, namely gvpA and gvpC. This switch could be applied to many areas, e.g. desalination, biofuel production and drug production, by simply changing the stimulus that would cause the switch to “flip”. Computer modelling showed that swimming was detrimental to floatation. In response we created knockouts of two different flagellar genes, motA and fliC. In vivo Gvp expression is toxic to E. coli. Instead, we focused on an RFP/GFP switch, which proved that our switch construct is viable. In the future, RFP and GFP can be replaced by any two functional genes that are desirable."

Through a yeast two-hybrid assay we will select a set of peptides that show affinity towards surface proteins from different fungi (Aspergillus nidulans, A. fumigatus, Candida albicans and C. glabrata). After confirming the interaction between the surface proteins and a given peptide, we intend to attach a molecule to the peptide marker. In our project, this molecule will be a fluorescent protein, but in principle can also be an immune system activator which is then recognized by the immune cells or other chemical moiety that adds novel functionalities or increases the peptide stability."

"Abstract":"In order to determine the replicative age of a yeast cell, researchers usually rely on direct micromanipulation of daughter cells and bud-scar counting. Given the long generation time of a cell (approx. 90 min), measuring its replicative lifespan is a laborious and time-consuming procedure. The goal of this project is to address this problem with a synthetic biology approach. We design and implement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a synthetic gene circuit that “colors” mother cells depending on their replicative age. We use a combination of endogenous elements and Crispr/Cas-based transcription factors to induce expression of different fluorescent proteins depending on the number of budding events that the mother cells have already experienced. We foresee that the successful outcome of this project will not only facilitate yeast age determination but will also pave the way to using cell sorters in order to fully automatize the procedure."

"Abstract":"Regulated gene expression is one of the primary means by which phenotypic differences are generated among genetically identical cells (e.g., endothelial cells versus nerve cells). Nonetheless, the concept of inducible gene expression is often difficult for students to understand. To help students gain a better understanding of inducible gene expression, we developed “BactoArt”, a multicomponent, inducible expression system that allows students to visualize gene regulation in action. First, different fluorescent protein (FP) color variants (e.g., CFP, GFP, or RFP) were placed under the control of specific inducible promoters. The inducers can then be patterend onto a petri dish—using either a paintbrush or an inkjet printer—before plating BactoArt bacteria, leading to selective induction of a given FP. We simultaneously induced GFP and RFP from pXyl and pLac, respectively, and measured their fluorescence intensity over time. We believe that such hands-on activities will spark questions, leading to “teachable moments” about transcriptional regulation."

These IPMs are the anti-biofilm protein Dispersin B and the quorum quenching protein AHLase. The gel is placed between two layers, a top layer to allow diffusion of gases and a bottom layer to contain the bacteria within the bandage. Hydrating the gel by breaking adjacent water pockets initiates the growth of the bacteria, thereby activating the bandage."

Organophosphates (OP) represent a large class of toxic pesticides used heavily in these areas. We have designed novel devices to detect these toxic pollutants in waterways called PUPS, or Paper Utilizing Pesticide Sensors. These devices are paper-based with 3D printed shells, making them very cost effective for use in poor areas worldwide. The PUPS will utilize a fusion protein that will be produced in E. coli to degrade organophosphates into 4-nitrophenol (4NP), which OPs degrade into naturally over time. The 4NP will then be reduced in order to electrochemically measure the 4NP concentration at cheap, graphite electrodes.

The idea is to build a robotic system linked to genetic engineering capable of processing and prepare small samples of blood in an automated manner. For this our team, will generate useful BioBriks records and parts for possible future insertions in the plates. This system will be coupled to biosensors capable of detecting breast cancer in its earliest stage, where the chances of the patient having an accurate diagnosis and treatment guidance are very high. The automation of the entire process, together with the creation of a specific biosensor for breast cancer, will result in a future decrease in deaths from the disease, due to a more rapid and effective treatment."

"Abstract":"The goal of our project is to use an antibody in combination with fluorescent probes to detect Ara h1, a major allergen protein in peanut. We use a detector which is divided into two components, one chemical and one physical. The chemical component is composed of three potential parts: one antibody complex linked to Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), one epitope complex linked to RFP, and finally Ara h1. These are potential parts in the sense that the system will always contain the first two parts (antibody and epitope complexes), but will only contain the third part, Ara h1, if the inserted food sample has been contaminated with peanut protein. The physical component, the biosensor system, is composed of a box containing sensors necessary to detect fluorescence and any eventual changes in fluorescence. This information is processed by a microprocessor to give a color indication, correlated to the changes in fluorescence."

"Abstract":"Increasing bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics remains a serious threat and urges the development of novel pathogen-killing strategies. Exploiting bacterial communication mechanisms such as quorum sensing is a promising strategy to specifically target certain pathogens. The major aim of this project is the introduction of a genetic circuit enabling Bacillus subtilis to actively detect, attach to, and eventually kill Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initially, we will introduce the autoinducer-sensing two-component systems of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae into B. subtilis to create a pathogen-detecting strain. By utilizing quorum sensing-dependent promoters, we will then trigger pathogen-killing strategies like the production of antimicrobial peptides or biofilm degradation. As a safety measure a delayed suicide-switch guarantees non-persistence of genetically modified B. subtilis in the absence of pathogens. We envision the use of BaKillus as a smart, cheap and simple-to-use medical device for diagnostics and targeted treatment of multiresistant superbugs."

However, MFCs is hard to determine the contaminants concentrations which is a major drawback for MFCs applications. We found that the electricity produced by MFCs was somewhat related to the substrates concentrations such as P-nitrophenol (PNP) in anode or Chromium (VI) in cathode. Then a novel MFC system was designed. For anode strain, we’ve cloned a PNP sensor sequence and a riboflavin into Escherichia coli. The recombinants is able to detect PNP and produce riboflavin to boost electrical generation when co-cultured with Shewanella oneidensis. In the cathode, gene codes chromate (VI) reductase Yief was cloned into E.coli. The stability of MFCs has been improved and the electricity generated was correlated with the substrates. Moreover, we’ve designed a program which can monitor the contaminants concentrations in MFCs."

It takes hundreds of years for plastic bottles to biodegrade, and the degrading process emits toxic chemicals into the air. We may alter the destiny of plastic in useful way. Our project aims to keep the environment clean with the degradation of PET to pyruvate by E. coli. With this project, while the environment will be cleaned from PET, the E. coli would add pyruvate to the cell cycle and use it as a new energy source for itself. We will biodegrade PET to Catechol.

Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol’s acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowdsourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocol’s acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated."

Rising levels of mercury due to mining activities, industrial catalysts, agricultural fungicides, and the burning of fossil fuels has resulted in the pollution of many ecosystems and water reservoirs. Cleanup of mercury contamination using current technology is either not feasible or incredibly costly. This study describes the engineering of recombinant bacteria that can facilitate the bioremediation of the neurotoxic methylmercury and mercury ions into less toxic form, and reduce other heavy metals. This synthetic microbe was encapsulated within a cost-effective, scalable water filtering device. Device employment could rigorously change the practices used in mercury decontamination efforts by switching to biological rather than chemical processes.

These cause neuron death and disrupt the proper functioning of surviving neurons. Despite the severity of the disease, Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment are limited to post-symptomatic psychological methods and so there is great need for molecular detection and alleviation mechanisms. To address this, we have genetically engineered a system to diagnose and treat Alzheimer’s disease. Diagnosis is based on the detection of two Alzheimer’s-specific biomarkers in the brain: extracellular beta-amyloid protein oligomers and the intracellular miRNA profile of afflicted neurons. Successful detection triggers a treatment module that reduces beta-amyloid levels, thereby preventing neuronal death and slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s symptoms. This research demonstrates an approach that could inform an eventual treatment, not only for Alzheimer’s disease, but for numerous other human afflictions."

Rhamnolipid, a widely-used biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa under aerobic conditions, is helpful in reducing oil-water interfacial tension, which makes it easier to remove oil. However, because of the anaerobic environment in oil reservoirs, rhamnolipid has to be produced ex situ, and then injected into the oil reservoirs. Our project is to build a bacterial strain that is able to utilize oil as its carbon resource as well as producing rhamnolipid in anaerobic environment. We start with a Pseudomonas stutzeri strain that lives in the oil reservoirs, clone and make it express the rhamnosyltransferase operon genes rhlABRI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa so that it can produce and excrete rhamnolipid into the oil constantly.

Currently, the use of pheromone traps is one of the cleanest methods to specifically attract and kill insects. Instead of carrying out the complex biosynthesis pathway of pheromones, we choose the simple act of expressing the DNA sequence of Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN). PBAN is similar to pheromone in its species-specificity. Once a specific PBAN comes in contact with and stimulates the target species, specific pheromones will be emitted to attract more of said species. In our project, we have successfully constructed and expressed in E. coli PBANs of nine different species and also built a capturing device. Hopefully this model can be widely used in the future when PBANs of more insects are found."

The ability to quickly and inducibly degrade a signal, repressor, or other protein would greatly improve the sensitivity and timing of biological switches. Auxin, a plant hormone, is involved in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. In the presence of auxin, auxin receptors induce polyubiquitylation of a targeted protein, leading to degradation by the proteasome. This hormone based protein degradation has previously been used to create inducible protein degradation in yeast and mammalian cells. However, a parallel system – using jasmonic acid as the small molecule inducer – is also found in plants. Our goal is to use both the auxin and jasmonic acid responsive pathways to develop a quick, efficient, and bioorthogonal system to control protein stability in yeast. "

Hence Peking iGEM is dedicated to constructing engineered microorganisms for the elimination of algae and recovery of ecosystems. A specific antimicrobial peptide is secreted to disrupt the outer membrane of algae. In addition, we equip our transgenic cells with features that allow for buoyancy and attachment, making our project more efficient. During this process, an enzyme is also secreted to degrade a deleterious product of algae. After eradicating the algae, our engineered bacteria will commit suicide, and the ecosystem is finally restored. This project is an innovative treatment for water bloom, and has potential applications in the field of ecosystem remediation."

"Description":"Next-Generation Approaches to Overcome the Challenges of Metabolic Pathway Engineering",
"Abstract":"Engineering metabolic pathways requires answering several questions and often performing many experiments. We sought to answer such “combinatorial questions” using new biophysical models and experimental approaches. First, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify the missing enzymes of a metabolic pathway that functions in one organism, but not in another. We demonstrate our approach on a 5-enzyme catabolic pathway that functions in P. putida, but not in E. coli. Once a multi-enzyme pathway functions in a preferred host, the DNA sequence of the system must then be optimized to achieve a desired metabolic activity. We took a forward engineering approach to systematically investigate the differences in translation rate capacity when using either “frequent”, “fast”, “rare”, or “slow” synonymous codons during codon optimization of protein coding sequences. Our research will enable metabolic engineers to overcome two of the most commonly encountered combinatorial questions during metabolic pathway engineering."

While available software allows rapid overlap design for constructs of conventional size, details of its functioning are not always fully transparent. MUFASA aims not only at facilitating the scarless cloning from the oligonucleotide design to putting the tubes into the thermocycler, but also at designing the fragments themselves in parallel with the overlaps for synthesis of big constructs de novo. Use of multiple overlaps pose a risk of non-specific hybridization and overlap “shadowing”. Such “shadowy places” may be eliminated by thermodynamic sequence optimization of both CPEC primers and fragments of the desired construct."

Induced expression of serine recombinases, capable of specific DNA editing, enables construction of biological analogues of transistors - transcriptors - and their use as elementary memory units called SR-latches. The fourth, strobe signal resets the system to its original state. We have shown that the system could efficiently store data about previous contact with inducing sugars across hundreds of generations. This memory unit offers high sensitivity in inducer detection and signal amplification, allowing cheap induction or further development and use as a trace contaminants sensor. Eight possible output combinations, reported as RGB fluorescent proteins, may also turn out to be useful for complex coexpression research."

A solution is presented by utilizing synthetic biology to engineer Bacillus subtilis to increase plants’ ability to uptake iron, through production of plant phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating molecules that many microorganisms and plants use to increase bioavailable iron by reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+. Our genetically engineered system combines five corn genes to produce these phytosiderophores: SAMS, NAS1, NAATI, DMAS, and TOM1. We are using corn and rice to confirm that plants grown with our engineered bacteria will have higher iron content than plants grown with wild-type Bacillus or with no Bacillus at all.

This phenomenon, termed protein splicing, allows inteins to be a point of control in forming mature and functional protein products. Current genetic circuits are limited by transcriptional lag, rendering them limited in applications which require fidelity and responsiveness. Inteins represent an innovative solution to improving the sensitivity of biosensors and synthetic circuits circumventing this lag and controlling the output of the circuit at the protein level. Here, we have created an intein toolkit, designed to introduce and facilitate the use of inteins in future iGEM projects. We have engineered several inducible intein switches capable of being activated by common environmental triggers as well as small molecules. To showcase the utility of inteins, we have also developed an intein based system to tackle mitochondria disease by allotropically expressing and transporting mitochondria proteins using inteins."

They could power the social, welfare and economic growth for the 1.2 billion people without access to electricity. BPVs take advantage of photosynthetic organisms by harnessing the electrons they produce from water and sunlight.

In theory, using enzymes instead would eliminate all deleterious side reactions, allowing for extremely high levels of efficiency that would lead to very inexpensive gene-length DNA synthesis.

For the heterologous expression of polyketide synthases(PKSs), the main method of the technology is transferring full gene cluster into heterologous host strains. However, such method can’t synthetize various polyketides by the same polyketide synthase domains. This year, we are dedicated to using PKS domains as a synthetic unit to diminish the size of the target gene fragments. Meanwhile, the host strain E. coli should be genetically modified in order to enable the synthesis of the corresponding substrate. In this way, PKS domains can be assembled more quickly, enabling the programmed polyketide synthesis. In addition, we can design synthesis pathway of polyketide independently.

The inducible plasmid-loss system is implemented by creating a plasmid containing CRISPR/Cas9, an RNA-guided nuclease system which targets and cleaves itself. A population containing this plasmid is expected to revert to wild-type upon activation. In addition to encouraging the application of evolutionary approaches to the field of synthetic biology, this project also contributes to making synthetic organisms safe for routine use outside the lab."

"Abstract":"Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affects more than 17 million people worldwide, and current treatments for T1DM, known as insulin therapy, require continued insulin injection, diet control, and constant monitoring of blood sugar. While gene therapy methods that restore insulin production in non-pancreatic cells might provide a one-shot cure for T1DB. We propose a gene therapy for T1DM using an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that transfects somatic cells with an insulin gene controlled by a glucose-sensitive promoter, thus potentially able to restore glucose-regulated insulin production in diabetic patients. Preliminary testing is conducted on cell lines to assess the efficiency of the therapy."

"Abstract":"Our team will develop a microbial based sensor –ELECTRACE. The great innovation of our project consists on the biosensor’s ability to produce a directly measurable electric signal as output. Electrical conductivity is a novel output that is orthogonal to all other standard outputs currently in use, such as fluorescence. In this way we will overcome the difficulties that arise by using conventional output signals, which are hard to quantify and to use outside the lab. The sensor-output system will be implemented in a microfluidics set-up, offering the possibility of designing a cost effective device that could be used at a large scale. ELECTRACE enables the interface between biology and electronics and fundamentally broadens the range of applications for synthetic biology. As a proof of principle, we will realize a system that is able to detect landmines. Additionally, the pathway that will be implemented can be extended to several other applications."

We obtained proof of concept that our developed Clickable Outer Membrane Proteins (COMP) enable this fast and effective click reaction. We apply it to create a safe “clicked-on” coating allowing E.coli to be used in the human body for healthcare purposes. Furthermore, microfluidic devices have been designed, ensuring increased control over the click reaction and single cell coating. We believe our “Plug-and-Play” system is a versatile tool providing numerous possibilities for engineering bacteria on outer membranes."

To achieve this, we integrated a DNA delivery system that works in situ and a sequence-specific DNA digestion system that works in vivo. The main advantage our work provides against suicide switches, a different type of security system for GMOs, is that our technology does not trigger a “shut down” to the target organism.

The merRNA is believed to sequester cyclic-di-GMP, much like a sponge. Since cyclic-di-GMP is a second messenger for various cellular functions, including motility and biofilm formation, the Tufts iGEM team introduced this merRNA sequence into E. coli. Constitutive expression of this merRNA transcript was shown to increase biofilm formation. This property can be useful in microbe-based approaches to environmental remediation. Earlier designs for phage delivery of the merRNA to disrupt biofilms inspired an investigation into the policy surrounding engineered bacteriophage. Tufts iGEM will be convening a panel of experts from various disciplines to put forth recommendations for the responsible use of phage in therapeutic and industrial applications.

"Abstract":"Directed evolution engineers organisms to produce proteins of novel function and industrially relevant biomolecules. Traditionally, in vivo directed evolution relies on physical or chemical mutagens that cause accumulation of toxic and nonspecific deleterious mutations. A novel system, termed feedback-regulated evolution of phenotype (FREP), overcomes these problems by incorporating a variable mutation rate system to mimic natural evolution. This is achieved through the dynamic control of a mutator element negatively regulated by the desired end product. The 2014 UChicago iGEM team implemented and optimized FREP in E. coli, using the tyrosine pathway as a proof of concept. We combined multiple mutators with different b deeper exploration of the search space, increasing the initial mutation rate and speeding the accumulation of beneficial mutations. Eliminating mutational bias should increase sequence space search efficiency, significantly improving the process of directed evolution for industrial production of any biomolecule."

Inspired by nature’s design, we aim to engineer E. coli to produce genetically programmed synthetic fibers, and standardize the customization of their physical and functional properties. We have adapted Iterative Capped Assembly to modularize and flexibly control the assembly of silk domains that confer strength or elasticity in specific ratios.

Our second goal is to increase the efficiency of the MFC by altering growth patterns of the bacteria. Current density has been shown to be dependent on biofilm formation by the electrogenic bacteria within the MFC[8]. Therefore we plan to increase current density by increasing biofilm growth."

Coupling this contact-dependent system to gene control allows us to create a reporter bacterium that will glow on contact with pathogenic bacteria, exposing potential pathogens before they have a chance to infect their host.

Our project seeks to understand complex intercellular interactions underlying specific community phenotypes by engineering communication motifs with the goal of reaching a community behavior to either converge or diverge in response. To do this, we have engineered novel sense-and-secrete circuits into yeast. To model community signaling, we repurposed endogenous yeast mating factor alpha(MFα) as an extracellular signal. Our designed circuit outputs initial individual responses to stimuli as GFP signal and, after signaling through secreted MFα, a downstream community-coordinated response is reported as RFP signal.

We took advantage of the nature of Caulobacter crescents (C.crescents), which is the ability to attach to a diverse range of surface by developing holdfast, to design circuits in C.crescentus in which light of different wavelength and intensity could trigger expression of corresponding florescent proteins as well as the enhancement of holdfast. So that C.crescentus can locate themselves correctly and present image colorfully. We also found that allosteric RNA operating as riboswitch is a promising alternative to proteins for synthetic chemical circuits due to its many distinct advantages such as rapid response and specificity. So we designed logic gates base on RNA switches to replace previous passway to create a faster C.imager."

"Abstract":"Treating infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with antibiotics disrupts a patient’s gut microbiota and can increase the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains. The increasing population of multi-drug resistant bacterial strains, both within and outside of health centers, is a growing health concern that is becoming progressively difficult to treat.We envision a new paradigm for treating infections of the human gastrointestinal tract through exploitation of engineered probiotics that produce anti-microbials with high specificity for pathogens at the genome level. Toward this end, we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 system with gRNA engineered to recognize genes from infectious bacteria. Our CRISPR/Cas9 system will be delivered from the engineered E. coli to infectious bacteria using bacterial specific phages, minimizing any side-effects to native microbiota and human-host cells. As a proof-of-principle for our engineered probiotic, we start by targeting the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholera."

Gene cassettes with an attC recognition site are site selectively recombined into an attI recognition site by the integron integrase. We are seeking to design biobrick compatible integron components that can be used as a novel, convenient and selective cloning system in lab strains of E. coli, which normally do not contain integron systems. Additionally, we are investigating regulation of natural transformation mechanisms in E. coli in an attempt to allow uptake and recombination of attC containing genetic elements with added convenience.

Even though they are relatively harmless to humans, laundry detergents contain caustic chemicals and reagents that have a detrimental impact on the environment. Our aim is to use enzymatic means of cleaning to reduce the amount of detergent necessary for normal washes as well as increase the efficiency of stain removal. We have engineered E. coli to produce enzymes that can be used to remove laundry stains such as grass, starch, and oils. By functionalizing these enzymes on a bioplastic material that can be used as an additive to traditional laundry cycles, we hope to improve the sanitation of clothing and other washable materials. The demonstration of enzyme functionality after biological immobilization will create a platform for future teams to display enzymes relevant to other applications."

Such memory devices include a cellular counter; a fundamental device which memorizes the number of induction events. Recent efforts have resulted in a cellular counter that can count up to three events. However, this counter cannot be reset to its initial state. Here, we propose a resettable cellular counter called “sigma recounter”. This counter utilizes the regulation system of sigma factor and anti-sigma factor as the key of its resetting mechanism. In this system a set of sigma factors are designed to update and maintain a count that responds to each inducted event. By the other stimulus, the system initiates a genetic circuit that can express a suitable set of anti-sigma factors and erases the existing memory, which will enable our device to restart the count from any state."

From a single class of molecule, the terpenoids, come properties including agents with therapeutic qualities against maladies ranging from cancer to infection, antimicrobials, natural pesticides, rich flavorants, and fragrant scents. However, the utilization of these remarkable compounds has been severely hindered by their rarity in nature: many are found in only a small number of species and produced at levels measured in parts per million. Synthetic biology offers an opportunity to resolve this problem, by applying metabolic engineering in order to create cellular factories.

Our project design is centered on the creation of BioBricks that facilitate the formation of an E.coli biofilm that captures and degrades nylon microplastics. Biofilm formation is achieved through the overexpression of the transcriptional regulator NhaR, which increases the production of poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PGA). This exopolysaccharide creates a stable biofilm capable of adhering microplastics. Microplastics are then degraded by manganese peroxidase and nylon hydrolase that are secreted by the biofilm. Using these modified E. coli, our team designed a biofilter to effectively remove the threat of microplastics from water supplies."

Upon sensing of fusaric acid excreted by F. oxysporum, fungal growth inhibitors will be produced by P. putida to prevent infection of the banana plants. To minimize the environmental impact of the fungal inhibitors to the soil microbiome, the bacteria will contain a kill switch that will cause it to terminate once the threat of F. oxysporum to the bananas has been alleviated. Furthermore, a double dependent plasmid system will be used to prevent the spread of artificial genetic material to surrounding soil bacteria. In summary, we hope to develop a showcase for the use of synthetic biology in agriculture in a safe and sustainable way."

Basing on Salmonella iron-binding system we modified lanthanide binding tags to adjust them to different ionic size. We also used a superfolder GFP to measure the concentration of collected ions. When an ion binds to LBT, a signalling pathway is activated, inducing fluorescence. Our project introduces an eco-friendly retrieval technology for industrially significant elements.

In addition, the ability to regulate the level of expression of a gene using such vectors proves difficult. Therefore, we aim to create a modular, self-replicating RNA system using Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) derived RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). This drives production of siRNA directed against the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) which is elevated in type 2 diabetes and is the target of major drug studies. The replicon contains control modules, exhibiting a negative feedback mechanism provided by: an MS2 domain linked to RdRp, thereby controlling RdRp translation and therefore controlling replication, and an aptazyme switch to regulate expression levels of our siRNA. Validation of our system and the testing of modules will be performed in human (Huh 7.5) and E. coli cells."

Our team has developed a high throughput method to select for the increased expression and stability of engineered proteins, making them more amenable to large-scale production in Escherichia coli and other downstream applications. Our method involves the insertion of proteins into a Gal4-VP16 transactivator that binds a promoter directly upstream of a GFP gene. This allows for the subsequent selection of mutants associated with higher GFP output, correlating to higher stability, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Additionally, our method utilizes degrons to alter the dynamic range of this GFP output. This revolutionary method is a potentially generalizable alternative to current, labor intensive approaches for the selection of stable protein variants. Engineered proteins selected through this method could be produced in bacteria and aid in the development of thermostable, de novo protein therapeutics."

This will effectively disable the antibiotic resistant phenotype over time so that a β-lactam antibiotic can then be administered to kill the MRSA. As a proof of concept, our gene silencing mechanisms will target a YFP gene within a Staphylococcus population.

Over-prescription of antibiotics promotes resistance in both livestock pathogens and natural flora, which can be transmitted to humans through meat and other products. A cheap, quick, and reliable mechanism for detecting and identifying infection is one solution to this problem.

Initially, they used isolated enzymes, which can be disadvantageous for that enzymes are always destabilized in the isolation and purification process.

In our Project, we aimed to build mechanisms to cure both of these diseases, as one is causing each other.  We decided to modify E. Coli to cure ulcer by producing Pexiganan(an antimicrobial peptide which is effective on H. Pylori), showing chemotaxis to damaged part of stomach, having a faster flagella for penetration.To cure the cancer, we designed switch system which is based on differences of miRNA concentrations,which are down-regulated or up-regulated in cancer cells leading to the final process of apoptosis. We hope that, our approaches will  find new ways about classifying cancer cells and modifying E. Coli to cure ulcer."

"Abstract":"Heat management and regulation is one of the biggest issues of 21st Century. Especially after the development of the refrigeration technologies, the world has adapted to thermo-regulation systems in real-life application, industry and science. This continuing adaptation has led to the dependence on temperature wise systems and their maintenance. The system we wish design in this occasion hopes to combat the issue of heat regulation that contests scientists and firms alike. 'Mr. Pyrofrost' will maintain the temperature of the system at a specific temperature through the functioning of two inversely affecting reactions regulated by the temperature of the system itself. The system stimulates an endothermic reaction pathway in higher temperatures and an exothermic reaction pathway in lower temperatures with one system inhibiting the other during function. The heat conditions of the system will both affect the functioning of 'Mr. Pyrofrost' and also be regulated by 'Mr. Pyrofrost'."

"Description":"Evolutionary Stability of Genetic Devices",
"Abstract":"After an organism is reprogrammed with a genetic device, the device will often mutate, or 'break', decreasing the metabolic load on the organism and giving it a competitive advantage. This commonly allows the organism with the broken genetic device to dominate the population, undermining the purpose of the original reprogramming. Our goal is to characterize sequences within genes and plasmids that are more likely to mutate, since our research suggests that certain devices are more easily broken than others. We expanded on this research by transforming four E. coli strains with fluorescent protein plasmids. Breaking times varied noticeably between strains, suggesting that the host's own genetic material also influenced device stability. Based on our findings, we decided to increase the stability of a few genetic devices, including the pDCAF3 plasmid, which the 2012 UT Austin iGEM team designed to allow E. coli to measure caffeine content through caffeine metabolism."

Endosymbionts endowed with the ability to enter, survive, and replicate stably within the mammalian cytoplasm could provide hosts with in vivo protein production. This technology would have the potential to treat monogenic disorders - in lieu of genome-level modifications - as well as a broad range of peptide-related conditions. This year, we optimised entry of three bacterial species (E. coli, Synechocystis PCC6803 and Lactococcus lactis) into mammalian cells and assayed them for intrinsic compatibility to the cytosolic environment. In the future, endosymbionts will be used as synthetic organelles, enabling a whole new field of synthetic biology - endosynbiology."

Now we are constructing the Enzymatic Flagellulose to degrade microplastics into biodegradable compounds.  It consists of a surface made up of cellulose, which acts as a biocompatible carrier, to which bacterial flagella will be immobilized via a cellulose-binding domain. The single flagellum subunits, also known as flagellin, will be interlinked with plastic degrading enzymes.   Using flagella as a scaffold for enzymes has two major advantages. Firstly, it enables the creation of a three-dimensional reactive nanostructure that has an increased specific surface with highly catalytic activity. Secondly, flagella may consist of various different active sites, which will enable the combination of multiple enzymatic steps in close proximity."

"Abstract":"Despite recent treatment advancements, cancer is still a major cause of mortality worldwide. One of the fundamental problems preventing the development of effective therapy is the difficulty to target cancer cells exclusively. In Boomerang, we're engineering a genetic device based on a simple concept of AND logic gate: the activation of our CRISPR/Cas9-based system is dependent on the existence of two cancer-specific promoters that control the expression of Cas9 and gRNA, and the combination of these two will occur only in cancer cells. CRISPR/Cas9 system allows several applications of Boomerang: 1) disruption of genes essential for cancer survival; and 2) activation of suicide genes, or color proteins for cancer cell detection (e.g., for complete surgical removal). Our system can be potentially designed according to unique characteristics of a patient's tumor, paving the way to personalized medicine.

Although diseases such as multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), leprosy and syphilis primarily pose a threat to those living in the world's poorest countries at present, increasing globalisation is rapidly transforming these diseases into a worldwide problem. This issue can only be addressed by developing an affordable diagnostic method that requires minimal training.      Enterobacteria phage lambda is a well-characterised virus of Escherichia coli, which has previously been used in the development of biotechnological tools. We aim to use this bacteriophage as the basis of a modular chassis with a variable host range.

So BIT-CHINA designed an intelligent pH-Controller inside the cell. Our pH-Controller contains two sub-systems. One is resistance system, and the other is fine-regulation system. Resistance system can make bacteria survive in an expanded range of pH. Fine-regulation system is used to adjust the environmental pH by synthesis of acid or alkali. Several kinds of recombinase were applied in this sub-system to achieve various regulation effectiveness. The two sub-systems working together allows for lowered artificial pH regulation costs in industrial fermentation, meanwhile the two systems also can regulate the pH of soil, because the hosts with our pH-Controller will maintain high efficiency when the environmental pH is not optimal and they can adjust the environmental pH as we expect. Combined with the projects we did before, our project can achieve more functions."

Our project, which concerns mainly on the crucially pathogenic organism nematode first, intends to build a kind of novel engineering bacteria which contain a switch promoter that controlled by the light intensity. It means that our bacteria will express organics to allure pests at night, and synthesis specific toxin to kill the pests after they devour them during the day.

"Abstract":"The field of synthetic biology seeks to engineer desirable cellular functionalities by developing molecular technologies that enable precise genetic manipulation. A promising solution is to reliably control proteins that naturally execute genetic modifications. Current strategies to regulate activity of such proteins primarily rely on modulating protein expression level through transcriptional control; however, these methods are susceptible to slow response and leaky expression. In contrast, strategies that exploit post-translational regulation of activity, such as conditional dimerization of split protein halves, have been demonstrated to bypass these limitations. Here, we compare the relative efficiency of previously characterized dimerization domains in regulating activities of three important genetic manipulation proteins - integrases and recombination directionality factors for genetic logic applications, and saCas9 for in vivo genome editing applications. We also establish guidelines to rationally identify promising protein split sites. Our characterization of these systems in mammalian cells ultimately paves way for important biomedical applications."

Experts estimate that honeybees pollinate $14 billion worth of crops per year in United States. Though the mechanisms which CCD occur are many fold and remain uncertain, neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated. Gilliamella apicola is a bacterium that natively resides in the bee midgut. Our project aims to engineer Gilliamella to metabolize imidacloprid, a common neonicotinoid, into harmless organic compounds using three cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP6CM1vQ, CYP6G1, and HUMCYPDB1. Though 6-CNA, the breakdown product of imidacloprid, displays significantly lower toxicity, it still induces sublethal effects. As such, we have also incorporated a pre-existing 6-CNA degradation pathway from Pseudomonas putida for complete breakdown of imidacloprid. We believe honeybees that harbour this engineered bacterium in probiotic form will become less susceptible to common field doses of imidacloprid; thus, significantly reducing the risk of CCD."

Terpenoid production will then be achieved via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway which is endogenous to E. coli. By increasing flux through the MEP pathway we will increase product yields. Safety considerations have been incorporated into the project through design of cellular level biocontainment. A kill switch, KillerRed, has been improved from previous years.

Over a billion unique tests are made accessible to field experts outside of synthetic biology with a unique clone-free assembly feature. Tumor mobility is incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and the complexity of surface marker combinations. The IOD band strives to make it easy. The central players are processing units called Input Output Diploids or IODs. IODs use antigen recognition and intercellular communication to create a logical network by which even single cells carrying the desired marker profile can be identified in a background of millions. Affirmative CTC localisation triggers a global response manifested by IOD initiated clumping at levels visible to the naked eye. As such, IOD bands do in a test tube what normally requires days to do in the lab."

"Abstract":"Flavonoids such as anthocyanins have multiple health benefits and potential to use as natural health products and colorants. The anthocyanin delphinidin is plentiful in ripened blueberries and is responsible for giving them their blue color. Our goal is to engineer a biosynthetic pathway in the model organism Escherichia coli that produces delphinidin. Nine genes are required for the conversion of phenylalanine, which occurs naturally in E. coli, to delphinidin. We have cloned or synthesized all nine plant genes. Our approach is to assemble the nine plant-derived genes into 3 operons and express them in E. coli. Production of specific enzymes will be verified by immunoblotting and production of intermediate compounds will be monitored by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.  Production of delphinidin in E. coli will provide a robust phenotype that may be exploited to identify factors that can increase production of useful pigments such as delphinidin and also related compounds."

The two ends join a half-reporter enzyme called HAD. each half of the enzyme is attached a molecule such as color coded GFP. When the Gln H comes into contact with glutamine the closed ends, when the two halves of HAD enzyme connect the enzyme becomes active, followed by a color reaction which can be seen by the human eye.

"Abstract":"Non-ribosomal peptides have important anti-bacterial, anti-cancer, and immunosuppressive  biological activities. They are synthesized by modular, high molecular weight enzymes that assemble more than 500 different amino acid substrates in an assembly line manner. For this reason, synthetic biologists have tried to engineer these proteins and to switch modules to create analogs and novel natural products, but with little success. Despite being modular, the interactions between modules have evolved to be highly specific, making synthetic  Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthases (NRPS) a challenge to engineer. Instead of switching modules we introduced a recombination system targeting oligo integration in Bacillus subtilis. We used the recombineering system to alter the active sites determining substrate specificity, thereby creating variants of antibiotics. Our focus was the tyrocidine antibiotic, which cannot be used intravenously due to its toxicity. Our goal is to create new analogs through multiplex automated genome engineering to reduce toxicity."

This phenomenon is explored as a circuit for sensing DNA sequence rather than protein. If a sequence is present, dCas9 will titrate away from a synthetic binding site upstream of a report gene to the desired sequence. In our project, we looked at this gene circuit in the context of detecting antibiotic resistance to activate a cell death gene. In preparing for this, we also performed a review of existing BioBricks and novel cell death genes in terms of their efficacy and safety.

Our discussions with law makers, law enforcers, and forensic scientists inspired three specific areas. First, the ability to pinpoint exactly when a fingerprint was made would have serious implications for delivering justice. We have designed a synthetic enzyme-based system to tackle this. Second, detection of different types of bodily fluids at a crime scene, while leaving DNA uncontaminated, would be of benefit. We therefore designed a cell-free synthetic spray to highlight traces of blood, semen, saliva, and nasal mucus on surfaces. Finally, the quantification of traces of stainless steel on bone.

"Abstract":"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a serious problem in the medical community. Detecting antibiotic resistance quickly is crucial to determine the correct treatment for different patients and for setting up quarantines to prevent spreading. We hypothesized that is possible to use quorum sensing (QS) to devise a rapid way for cells to report the existence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we developed a reporter cell that expresses GFP in the presence of the QS signaling molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Our test cells (which act as a simulation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) express lactonase, which breaks down AHL. In our experimental system, test cells should signify their presence by breaking down AHL and preventing GFP expression in reporter cells. Therefore, our project serves as a proof of principle and we hope that our work will serve as a basis for developing similar, more sophisticated quorum sensing-based detection systems in the future."

"Abstract":"Engineering transcriptional logic gates to program cellular behavior remains an important challenge for synthetic biology. Currently, genetic circuits reproducing digital logic are limited in scalability and robustness by output discrepancies and crosstalk between transcriptional pathways. We propose to address these issues using RNA-guided dCas9 fused to a transcription activation domain as a programmable transcription factor. Fusion dCas9 targeted upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS) recruits RNA polymerase. Yet, dCas9 may also sterically hinder transcription initiation if bound too close to the TSS. The guide RNA acts as a 'biological wire': it determines dCas9's binding site and enables specific regulation of homogenous synthetic promoters. Exploiting these properties we aim to build biocompatible transistor-like elements whose assembly may allow for the creation of chainable and parallelizable bio-logic gates. Ultimately, we hope to create a toolkit facilitating the design and implementation of bio-logic circuits thereby enabling more complex decision-making in cells."

"Abstract":"Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are indicators of the initial stages of metastasis. However, most state-of-the-art detection methods target only a few cancer-type-specific markers. We developed a bacterial signal processing system for sensitive and selective single-cell detection of CTCs in blood samples. We start by selectively inducing apoptosis in CTCs using sTRAIL before adding our engineered Escherichia coli, called MicroBeacons. Through the expression of the Annexin V protein on their outer membrane, MicroBeacons bind to the apoptotic CTCs. Upon binding, MicroBeacons detect the increased lactate production of the CTCs via a lactate sensor and trigger quorum sensing between each other, which results in expression of fluorescent protein. Overall, the MicroBeacons selectively generate stronger fluorescence on the surface of sTRAIL-sensitive and lactate-secreting tumor cells compared to healthy cells. We anticipate our device to be a reliable, fast, and cheap method for the detection of metastasis for a wide range of cancers."

To address these issues, our team mainly focused on engineering a S. cerevisiae yeast immunotherapy that was ultimately tested in vivo on mice presenting melanoma. Three complementary strategies were combined: First, in order to modulate the tumor environment, yeast secreting immune modulators, GM-CSF and IFNgamma, were encapsulated into alginate beads and injected in tumors. Secondly, to break the immune tolerance against cancer cells, T4 and T8 lymphocytes were elicited by a yeast antigen display system. Last, to deliver cytotoxic compounds solely in the tumor environment, a yeast hypoxia bio-sensor was designed. A side project consisted in engineering E. coli to drive MAIT lymphocytes against cancer cells instead of their original targets, parasitized cells."

Different antigens are immobilized on a protein array generated by cell-free protein expression, using the corresponding DNA array as a template. Placed in a microfluidic chamber, the protein array is incubated with a patient's blood sample. The interaction between an antibody in the sample and the corresponding immobilized antigen results in a local change of the optical thickness of the surface. This change can be detected using a label-free and real-time measurement technology called iRIf (imaging Reflectometric Interference).

One was an efficiency of the circularization. The efficiency was lower in our previous study. This was why the splicing was hard to happen because two sequences to act as ribozyme for splicing were far each other. So we incorporated complementary sequences around the ribozyme regions. We thought that the treatment brought two regions close and the efficiency of the circularization improved.    The other was to synthesize useful proteins. In our previous study, synthesized long-chain proteins lose their function because the folding of the proteins was broken. So we incorporated linker sequences into circular mRNA to synthesize the functional long-chain protein."

The combination of the catalytic forces of enzymes, derived from different sources, onto one common molecular base creates a synergistic effect. This drives a cascade in which the product of one reaction acts as the substrate for the consecutive one.

By surface displayed silica binding peptides and secreted flocculating proteins, Euk.cement will target onto any silica containing particles, such as sands and rocks, and stick them together. This system will be automatically initiated only in dark with a light operated switch. While carbon dioxide released from the metabolism of cells will finally complete the calcium carbonate sedimentation. This economical and ecological friendly innovation can be utilized for a wide range of industrial or environmental applications, such as construction and restoration of building foundations, bridge piers, or even artificial reefs for aquaculture. Since we have exploited a new kind of marine yeast as chassis, the application field of eukaryotic synthetic biology has then been considerably broadened."

"Abstract":"With the ability to create a virtual reality by computer simulation, a mixed-reality era is coming! In this project, we are working on creating a new kind of life form, mixed-reality cells (MR. Cell), which are half-real and half-virtual. To demonstrate our idea, a genetic oscillator was built in E. coli as the real part and an e-oscillator was simulated in a computer as the virtual part. The two parts could interact with each other through an interface device composed of microfluidic chip and chemical/optical modulator. At the beginning, the two oscillators work independently in a dual-reality state. With their interaction, they would gradually adjust to each other without human interference to a strongly coupled and synchronized mixed-reality state. A prototype of MR. Cell was demonstrated in this project which has great potential in a wide range of the future biological research."

This bacteria is to be placed in a bioreactor prototype which takes in any polluting exhaust (e.g. from a diesel generator, automotive engine, or chimney) with a controllable flow rate. This is then passed through the media containing our genetically engineered bacteria, which reduces all the above mentioned harmful gases to harmless by-products. Bubbling of the exhaust through water before going into the bioreactor also takes care of soot and other unburnt hydrocarbons."

Food spoilage renders a product undesirable for consumption and is the outcome of the biochemical activity of a microbial community.    It is known that bacteria often communicate with each other through quorum sensing, where the communication is through certain signal molecules (auto-inducers) that freely diffuse into the environment.The enzymatic activities that account for quality degradation of food products are regulated by quorum sensing activity. Our engineered organism can be used as a marker of freshness in different kinds of food (dairy and other packaged products) by detecting the presence of Acyl Homoserine Lactones using the Lux operon system in E. coli and rendering a visible colour change (through lycopene production), thus preventing the consumption of such food and aiding healthy living."

We will synthesize a bacterial system that:   1. Senses the cell density of pathogenic bacteria  2. Releases anti-microbial peptides(to mimic anti-biotics) which kill pathogens, when it has sensed high cell density  3. As the population goes down we release a peptide that neutralizes the activity of anti-microbial peptides, resulting into a stress free environment.

First, we use special features of pET vectors to express two key enzymes, named formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and formaldehyde dehydrogenase (PADH). Then we add the gene of T7 RNA polymerase in the downstream of promoter hxlR in PSB1C3. Finally, when T7 polymerase is expressed, Vector pET-DUET can express PADH and FDH. In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it."

Attempting to explain this phenomenon, a genetic circuit that couples cell motility and chemotaxis in Escherichia coli was built. The transmembrane receptor dependent chemotactic signaling pathways in E. coli are well described. But so far, most of the pattern formation research focused on the Tar receptor together with its attractant aspartate. Here however, the attention goes to the function of another chemoreceptor, the Tsr receptor and its corresponding repellent - leucine. This novel approach, in combination with the controlled expression of the motility regulating protein CheZ, enables precise steering of the swimming behavior. All together, this system allows the formation of periodic circles and stripes of high-low cell densities. Based on theoretical analysis, the formation of spatial structures arising from the aggregation process of cells A and intermediate stripes of cells B is expected."

Furthermore, current sensors rely upon upon the presence of electricity and power, and are thus unable to act in scenarios of natural disasters when CO leaks are most likely. This project introduces a CO-sensing mechanism into E.coli using a CooA transcription activator and corresponding pCoof promoter to regulate the expression of a methyl salicylate pathway (pchBA and BSMT genes).

Zeaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizes the membrane, and is needed for electron transport chain function. To increase the concentration of zeaxanthin and its precursors, we introduced a circuit containing parts of the zeaxanthin synthesis pathway. The La Cañada subset of our team focused on tocopherol, a metabolite that has similar properties to zeaxanthin in cyanobacteria. Tocopherol acts as an antioxidant, protects the cell from lipid peroxidation, and enhances photosynthesis. A circuit was made with the gene p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase to catalyze the formation of homogenistic acid, the rate limiting step of tocopherol synthesis. In an attempt to further increase the production of fatty acids, both zeaxanthin and tocopherol circuits are dynamically regulated, utilizing a fatty acid-sensitive promoter-repressor system, pLR and FadR."

Among the various staining techniques, silver staining is easy to perform and highly sensitive. However, the outcome is a series of monochromatic protein bands. Previously, we observed that some proteins inherently produce different hues post-staining. We hypothesized that specific amino acid configurations yield coloured bands after reacting with silver staining reagents. To test our hypothesis, we created numerous amino acid motifs to elucidate the sequences that would generate specific colours following silver staining. Our findings will let us generate a molecular weight marker with the innate capacity of providing users colour-coded bands post-staining without the use of impregnating dyes. Our technology will also pave the way for new types of colorimetric assays using synthetic proteins."

"Abstract":"Global problems concerning heavy metals, including metal contamination and metal recovery, have become increasingly significant in the aquatic environment. Among numerous heavy metals, such as toxic metals, noble metals and radioactive metals which can be viewed as potential resources, we focus on lead, gold and uranium. Here by using Bacillus subtilis as a bioreactor, we are working to devise a way to absorb and retrieve heavy metals. A 'Metallosniper' targeted at lead, gold and uranium has been successfully engineered. With the feature of producing endospores, we have made it possible for B. subtilis to absorb heavy metals under both benign conditions and adverse circumstances. In a gesture to further improve the efficiency of binding metals, biofilm, cell surface-display system and degradable materials for immobilization are applied in our project. We have also combined all these elements into a unique device for future industrial applications."

"Abstract":"Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) is an important, naturally occurring polyamide which has been widely used in foods, medicine, cosmetics and agriculture. We improved γ-PGA production in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LL3 and the produced γ-PGA was made into drug releasing hydrogel. In this study, two strategies were employed to improve B. amyloliquefaciens LL3 γ-PGA production. First, we constructed a metabolic toggle switch to control the expression of odhA (encoding 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase), thus interrupting the TCA cycle and favoring the metabolic flux toward γ-PGA precursor-glutamate synthesis. Second, in order to balance the increase of endogenous glutamate production, we optimized the expression level of pgsBCA genes (responsible for γ-PGA synthesis) by replacing its native promoter with seven different promoters with various transcriptional activities. We finally constructed a γ-PGA production improved B. amyloliquefaciens strain. In the meantime, the drug releasing hydrogel, Pudding Health Kit, functioned well protecting the exposed skin and healing the wounds."

Currently, several targeted therapies are simultaneously used to accurately treat cancer patients. Thus in our project, we established a multiple targeting detection platform. We modified Escherichia coli (E. coli) to display single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies from targeted drug monoclonal antibodies on the cell membrane to bind with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) antigens. The three separate anti-EGFR, anti-VEGF, and anti-HER2 E. coli systems can be unified to apply a multi-marker concept before, during, and after treatment. This novel detection approach can help medical professionals by generating more accurate diagnoses, which leads to a better prescription for patients."

To overcome these shortcuts, we design a system to achieve the storage of information by a transient stimulation but use a long-lasting response.    The two processes are divided into separated bacterial strains to play as the 'Recorder' and the 'Saver'. The system is designed to be activated and deactivated via light- regulated fusion proteins, which then active protein synthesis to complete the process. The information storage would be accomplished by conjugation, which cannot be carried out in usual time because of the specific gene deletion. When the memory needs to be erased, the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the 'Saver' would be activated.    By design such a cellular memory technology, we make a bacterial memory storage device.

We prepared exosomes (nano-sized vesicles secreted by endogenous cells) from cell factory that was engineered to express a rabies viral glycoprotein peptide (specifically recognize and target neuronal cells) on the exosomal membrane surface. By filling the exosomes with siRNA of the mu opioid receptor (MOR, a primary target for opioids) and injecting the exosomes into mouse bloodstream, we detected efficient passage of the siRNA through blood-brain barrier and specific accumulation of the siRNA in mouse brain. Consequently, siRNA-loaded exosomes significantly reduced MOR mRNA and protein levels in mice. To show the therapeutic potential, siRNA-loaded exosomes strongly restrained morphine-induced conditioned place preference in mice.

Studies suggest that resistant starches may reduce colon cancer by enabling colonic bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, including butyrate.  Our project took two approaches to increase colonic butyrate. The first approach was to develop a screen for enzymes that could transfer acyl/butyryl groups to alpha 1,4 carbohydrates in bacteria and plants. To support this we modelled and modified carbohydrate branching. Enzymatic modification of carbohydrates could also provide environmentally-friendly methods for the production of modified starches used in a wide range of industries. The second approach aimed to transfer the butyrate biosynthetic pathway to Escherichia coli.  Our work could be applied to the production of butyrylated starches for consumption as prebiotics or butyrate-producing probiotics.

In this system, different TALE proteins, which could specifically target the corresponding DNA binding motifs, were generated and fused with fragmented GFP or multi-enzymes (e.g., IAAM and IAAH). The results showed that TALE-based scaffold system could not only efficiently guide the fragmented GFP around the DNA scaffolds and display strong fluorescence, but also promote the rate of IAA production. To our knowledge, this technique might provide a powerful way in synthesizing multi-enzymatic reaction programs in prokaryotic chassis for a wide range of application."

Indole is produced from tryptophan by E.coli with the genes tnaA and tnaB. Similarly, lactic acid is produced from fructose by E. coli with the gene lldD.     After being attracted by the two organic compounds and flying into the trap, the mosquitoes will be stunned and electrocuted by an electric mesh. They will fall onto the medium containing the E.coli. The hard exoskeleton of the mosquitoes is digested by chitinase (produced by the gene ChiA in E.coli). With the hard outer exoskeletons removed, the mosquitoes serve as a carbon source to maintain E. coli's growth, hence creating a self-sustaining system. We hope that this trap will provide a cheap, sustainable alternative to current mosquito traps."

"Abstract":"Communication between cells is instrumental in coordinating population-level activity. In a process known as 'quorum sensing,' bacteria both secrete and sense autoinducer signaling molecules to enable synchronization of group gene expression paradigms. The synthetic biology community has rapidly adopted these quorum signaling pathways for use in programmed circuitry. However, chemical signals must diffuse between sender and receiver cells, limiting such communication to a common environment. In electronics, when electrical signals must be transferred between two circuits operating at incompatible voltages, electrical engineers use optocouplers, components that transfer information between isolated circuits via light. The 2015 Penn iGEM team presents a biological analog of the optocoupler, a cell-to-cell communication system in which a 'sender' cell generates light via bioluminesence and a 'receiver' cell expresses photoreceptors to enable light-dependent physiological responses. We show that light elicits a response in light-sensitive receivers and illuminated potential applications for this alternative form of cell communication."

The addition of the cyclopropane ring to fatty acid chains creates a sterically hindered path for acidic compounds attempting to cross the plasma membrane, thereby reducing the passive entrance of unwanted acids. We are aiming to standardize this acid defense system so that it may be implemented in other microorganisms to increase their survival under low pH conditions. By utilizing acid-resistant microbes, it is possible to decrease the running costs of bioreactors that are hindered by acid buildup from metabolic processes. Moreover, given that microbes often transition to stationary phase during acid stress, this CFA system may enable higher cell densities and biosynthetic yields in cell cultures because genetically modified microorganisms may more readily tolerate acidic conditions during growth."

ECs are able to chelate with cadmium ion. Our engineered bacteria can also identify different concentrations of cadmium ion turning blue for low concentration and red for high concentration."

"Abstract":"The misuse of antibiotics is endangering human health and ecological balance. In terms of medicine use, we can develop standards to use antibiotics reasonably. But agricultural uses of antibiotics produce environmental exposures in a variety of reservoirs, which are impossible to be guarded against. Our group has developed a simple, reliable and efficient method to measure the antibiotics.Our Tetracycline biosensor can detect the tetracycline residues in agricultural products (such as: meat, eggs, milk, etc.). Our group constructed the tetracycline inducible expression system. And through plasmid mediated, the system was transfected into Escherichia coli TOP10 and GS115 Pichia pastoris. It can generate a rtTA transcription activation factor in cells. RtTA combining with tetracycline antibiotics can activate the fluorescent protein expression system, which can indicate the residue level of tetracycline by fluorescence detection."

"Description":"MyocardialGuard",
"Abstract":"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in many developed countries. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) is a critical second messenger molecule involved in myocardial diseases such as  hypertrophy. This summer, we try to use synthetic biology to modify the cGMP metabolic pathway in a human cell line. We hope that our work would provide the proof of principle for future gene therapy. cGMP can transduce nitric oxide and natriuretic peptide coupled signaling and remit the myocardial hypertrophy by relaxing the blood vessels. We up-regulate the soluble guanylate cyclase(sGC), an enzyme that synthesize cGMP from GTP, by overexpressing the α and β subunits of sGC in a mammalian cell line. However, elevated level of cGMP leads to the feed-back expression of PDE5A, a cGMP-specific phosphodiesteras that degrades cGMP. Thus, we further modify the pathway by knocking down the PDE5A gene. To achieve controllable up-regulation of cGMP level in the cell, we also propose a hypoxia-inducible operon, HRE, as a switch to up regulate cGMP only in hypoxia situation."

As a matter of fact, the immigration to Mars, the most earthlike planet in solar system, still should be considered as priority. It is noticeable that CO2 and N2 occupy almost 98% of Martian atmosphere. Thus, we engineered two types of E.coli, which carry out anaerobic carbon fixation with Acetyl-CoA Synthetase/Carbon Monoxide Dehydrogenase(ACS/CODH) system, and nitrogen fixation with Paenibacillus nitrogenase respectively. Based on this purpose, they are called E. Pangu collectively, which is named after the creator of universe, Pan Gu in Chinese mythology. E. pangu is designated to play the role of pioneer organism on Mars immigration. In addition, we used CRISPR-Cas 9 technique to confirm the reliability of our carbon fixation system and verified a promoter part which can be induced by Rhl and repressed by Las."

"Abstract":"The nowadays production methods of antibodies are not only time-consuming and costly but are at the expense of animal lives. Antibodies have many applications in research, diagnostics, and show great promise in treatment of cancer. But the advancement is held back due to the expensive and tiresome production. Therefore we propose an alternative to antibodies; peptide aptamers  produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The variable loop of the peptide aptamer is generated through a random nucleotide library and held together by an enzymatic inactive version of human Thioredoxin (hThx) as a scaffold protein. We are using the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen for functioning peptide aptamers that are able to bind our chosen target proteins ('antigens'). In this model bacteria expressing a functioning peptide aptamer will express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP), which enables us to isolate them. To challenge the antibody tradition, we are also proposing a production model."

These protective compounds, specifically mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids, defend against oxidative stress by quenching free radicals and preventing cellular damage. A putative mycosporine-synthesizing gene cluster in the cyanobacteria Anabaena variabilis has been characterized previously. Our team seeks to optimize these genes for high-volume expression in E. coli and study their effects on bacterial survival rates under high-UV environments. The standardization of these genetic components into the iGEM registry will help foster collaborative research into the potential applications of mycosporine-like amino acids as alternatives to toxic synthetic sunscreens, protection for terraforming bacteria in harsh UV environments, and as antibiotic-free selectable markers for genetic engineering."

Runoff can carry field pesticide into aquatic environment while wind can carry them to other fields, potentially affecting other species. Over time, repeated application increases pest resistance and facilitate the pest resurgence. Further, especially in China, toxic pesticide residues on green vegetable and fruits become a major public health problem. In order to provide a solution, we design an engineered bacterium, secreting the OMP enzyme to degrade the common toxic pesticide residues. Its secretion is under the temperature control and can only be activated at specified temperature. To avoid the secondary pollution, a UV-induced suicide gene is inserted into the bacteria: upon exposure to UV or sunshine, the suicide procedure is induced. This purpose of the design is to remove toxic pesticide safely without affecting the environment."

There are already some methods to convert saltwater into freshwater, such as distillation and reverse osmosis. However, the high energy consumption of these technologies has limited their application. Therefore the development of an innovative, low-energy biological desalination process, by biological membranes of cyanobacteria, would be very attractive. Many cyanobacteria possess salt-tolerance mechanisms, among which sodium export is the most important one. Halorhodopsin is a light-driven inward-directed chloride pump from halobacteria.

"Abstract":"Butanol has proven to be effective as a biofuel and can be used in internal combustion engines without modification, thus reducing the need for already scarce oil. In nature, bacteria of Clostridium genus have been shown to produce butanol from butanoic acid. In the present study, C. acetobutylicum metabolic pathway for butanol production was introduced into E. coli via a construct, consisting of three genes (CtfA, CtfB and BdhB). Polypeptide CtfAB converts butyrate to butyryl-CoA, which is then transformed to butanol by means of BdhB dehydrogenase. Butyrate is formed as an intermediate product in a reaction pathway of direct biological conversion of waste. We successfully composed an optimized system of bioreactors to produce pure butanol and use all side products formed. In the first stage the waste is converted to biogas, natural fertilizer and butyrate, the latter being efficiently transformed to biobutanol in the second stage."

To ensure specific control of bacterial vectors, we intend to implement a two switch regulatory system, consisting of an anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter and a quorum-sensing system (QS).     An anaerobic-responsive FNR promoter can be used to localise transcription of the target gene in the hypoxic tumor core. The second switch will use the esa QS system from Pantoea stewartii to activate bacterial density induced transcription of genes. The above two systems could be coupled to drive the expression of invasin and listeriolysin, which facilitate bacterial invasion and endosomal escape into the cell cytosol.

We want to develop a transferable, biological detection system for different diseases using HER-2, a breast cancer biomarker, for a proof-of-prinicple. Therefore, we created a novel class of chimeric receptors based on the bacterial osmoregulator EnvZ. We substituted a part of the periplasmic domain of EnvZ with an exchangable, but highly-specific protein binder, an Affibody molecule. Upon antigen binding, the receptor would trigger the OmpR signaling cascade leading to the production of quorom sensing molecules which activate transcription of a fluorescent signal in a separated read-out strain. Taken together, this system could be a transferable method for biomarker detection."

We aim to create a durable system that can independently regulate blood glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemic crises and improve the quality of life of type II diabetics. We engineered E. coli that can detect changes in blood osmolarity and release pharmacologically active tripeptides in response. The tripeptides act on the kidneys by inhibiting the SGLT1 and SGLT2, two channels proteins that re-uptake glucose out of the urine. By inhibiting this reabsorption, the body is able to excrete excess glucose to counteract hyperglycemia.

EtnABCD is of great interest for biocatalytic epoxide production to replace current organic chemistry methods which present safety and environmental concerns.  Mycobacterium smegmatis is the only organism that endogenously expresses ethene monooxygenase, yet is a poor cloning host. To enhance the heterologous expression of the EtnABCD enzyme, a mathematical model was developed taking into account the differences in codon frequencies between organisms. The M. smegmatis gene encoding EtnABCD was modified using this model in order to obtain optimized sequences for expression in both Pseudomonas putida, as an intermediate host, and Escherichia coli. The altered EtnABCD sequences will be cloned into appropriate vector inserts. Once stable expression of EtnABCD is established in Pseudomonas putida, the E. coli optimized sequence will be expressed to give a high activity monooxygenase enzyme."

"Abstract":"MFCs are capable of converting the chemical energy stored in the chemical compounds in organic biomass to electrical energy with the aid of microorganisms. However, traditional single-strain MFC faces many practical barriers such as low current density, high cost and unstable electricity output, which seriously impede the future applications. To solve these problems, extending engineering capabilities from single-cell behaviors to multi-cellular microbial consortia brings us new inspiration. So we establish a co-cultured MFC system with an elaborate labor division.  Based on our complicated co-cultured system, a rational designed relationship of material, information and energy is being explored. We regulate lactate metabolism, the key point of material flux, through lactate sensing system, orthogonal targeted protease degradation, etc. Additionally, we also make riboflavin as the entry point to regulate energy and information relationship. Through reconstruction of the co-cultured MFC, a more efficient and robust system is built up."

"Description":"ExTermite coli: A new system to exterminate termites using engineered E. coli and pseudo egg",
"Abstract":"'ExTermite coli' is a novel system to exterminate termites, which combines an engineered Escherichia coli and a unique pseudo-egg delivery system. The E. coli was engineered to overexpress glucose-3-dehydrogenase (G3DH), which converts trehalose into the trehalase inhibitor 3,3'-diketo-trehalose (3,3'dkt). Because trehalose is a major termite blood sugar and trehalase is essential for trehalose metabolism, G3DH essentially converts trehalose into an insecticide. The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing β-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the  G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies. Consequently ExTermite coli can effectively exterminate termites in their nest."

"Abstract":"We want to replay the Prisoner's Dilemma, a well-known game analysed in game theory, by using E. coli. This game involves dilemma between cooperation and defection. Although each prisoner knows both player's cooperation mutually benefits each other, one will always defect when the individual is pursuing his or her own benefit. We will express this dilemma by using a genetic circuit centering in quorum sensing. We will also provide various strategies and aim to determine the best strategy in this game. By combining the idea with synthetic biology, we demonstrated this game   among students. We also made our own pay-off matrix. In our project we will focus on the prisoners' emotions as well. The metaphoric usage of cherry blossoms appears in countless Haikus and Tankas, and expresses the heart of the Japanese. Therefore, we will express the prisoners' emotions using E. coli, which will mimic the characteristics of cherry blossoms."

"Abstract":"The concentration of toxic chemical by-products from oil sands exploitations has been increasing since 2012. Recent efforts to address environmental pollution converge towards bioremediation as the most promising solution. While endogenous bacteria such as Pseudomonas Putida F1 can degrade toluene, we optimized E. coli to be more efficient at breaking down 3-methylcatechol, a rate-limiting step in the toluene degradation pathway. We did so by creating 2 plasmids that once co-transformed into E. coli would achieve the metabolization of toluene down to water and carbon dioxide. Additionally, a web application for visualizing, manipulating, and comparing genome-scale metabolic models of bacterial consortia was developed and used to analyse the introduction of our synthetic E. coli into the Athabasca river microbiome. We have created a framework to analyze the optimal solution to the problem present, by considering designs, associated cost profiles, and political risks in the context of Alberta's soil sand industry."

Our project aims at limiting its proliferation in hives, thus we designed a trap adaptable to the hive entrance. In this device, our Escherichia coli strain named ApiColi will be used as bait. During the day ApiColi will express butyrate as an attracting molecule to lure Varroa destructor in the trap. By night butyrate expression will be replaced by formate production, a deadly molecule for the mite. This circadian rhythm is based on a chimeric red light receptor, which enables our trap to be in line with the honeybee's life cycle and optimizes the lifespan of the device. Completion of this project will provide a solution to tackle the Varroa destructor in a way that is both respectful of the environment and the bees."

Such fungal infections significantly reduce sustainability and food production in developing countries, where lack of advanced food storage and mycotoxin exposure are responsible for severe economic losses and 40% of diseases. As such, our team focused on developing a secretable chitinase capable of hydrolysing the glycosidic bonds which compose the polysaccharide chitin, a key structural component in fungal cellular walls. By fusing LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding genes with a secretion signal peptide from alpha-amylase, we successfully generated an escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 extracellular secretion and effectiveness were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will allow for easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases that combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally."

Through the On/Off commands from light switchers, genetic manipulation can be achieved when diverse combinations of light signal are provided. Specifically, three light-mediated platforms are established: bio-imaging platform, genetic editing platform and information storage platform. For the first part, the expression of fluorescent protein can be precisely controlled by the incoming light, forming pre-determined image pattern with drastically high resolutions. For the second part, dCas9 and DNA-binding-domain-deleted recombinase are linked together to smoothly alter genetic information without introducing double strand breaks. For the third part, artificial information can be stored and retrieved easily via light-mediated systems.     We designed CRISPR-recombinase screening systems, measured fluorescent protein expression parameters and developed a light-emitting electronic device to support our project."

In order to permanently memorise the sensor state of the snapshot time point in cells we use an altered version of the DNA recombinase Cre to switch on a luciferase reporter. The ability to quickly capture the current state of the sensor is achieved by fusing Cre with two copies of the protein Dronpa, that oligomerises after illumination and thereby cages and inhibits the recombinase. Because the oligomerisation of Dronpa is reversible through another wavelength, we can control the activity of the recombinase and fine tune the read out of the luciferase reporter."

We seek to leverage the cellular penetration capabilities of the atoxic Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB) which very efficiently mediates endocytosis and escapes endosomal capture. By adding Cas9 upstream of the catalytically inactive glucosyltransferase domain of the toxin, we hope to develop a recombinant fusion protein that will deliver into the cytoplasm an NLS-tagged Cas9 bound to a guide RNA.

PACE combines the bacteriophage M13 and Escherichia coli in a dynamic scheme whereby M13 only survives if it infects E. coli. This is achieved when the viral protein P3 is expressed. SPACE-P aims to incorporate a key-lock mechanism that regulates the expression of P3. In our model, the interaction between the protein HER2 and an affibody will be the key to open the lock. Over several phage life cycles, evolutionary pressure will favour the interactions with the greatest yield of P3, thereby increasing that phages virulence and the continued evolution of that particular affibody.

As a first step towards such a platform, we are introducing a transmembrane biosensor which may in the future be incorporated into signaling pathways. The system is characterized by three modules, aptamers as recognition elements, outer-membrane proteins as the scaffold and signaling components which can translate ligand binding into a measurable signal through heterodimerization. Aptamers can be clicked onto the outer membrane proteins post-translationally using SPAAC click-chemistry, making the system inherently modular. The biosensors can be employed in a wide range of applications: from detecting biomarkers to the overuse of pesticides. We believe that in the future, the system can go beyond its function as a biosensor and may be able to trigger cellular responses."

UMassD proposes to create an alternative. An enzyme released by H. pylori which cleaves urea and releases ammonia as a byproduct  creating a pH buffered microenvironment.  It has been shown in previous studies that various peptides can inhibit urease activity in vitro.  The aim of our project is to engineer E. coli with a plasmid encoding a positively regulated, pH sensitive promoter.  The low pH will initiate the transcription of an inhibitory peptide coupled with a twin-arginine translocase leader sequence.  As a result, the decreased production of ammonia should inhibit H. pylori's buffering capacity, reducing its ability to persist within the stomach."

"Description":"Copper Bioremediation Using Genetically Engineered E. Coli",
"Abstract":"Copper is a major pollutant in a variety of freshwater ecosystems.  When copper is oxidized from Cu+ to Cu2+, it often produces a free radical known as a reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is capable of severely damaging biological molecules. E. coli have the ability to uptake copper, but after a certain threshold, the copper becomes toxic to the cell. Due to the toxicity of copper, E. coli quickly saturate and are unable to uptake more than a small amount of copper.    Our goal is to increase the efficiency of copper uptake in E. coli for the purpose of bioremediation in freshwater ecosystems. We engineered E. coli to express the yeast CUP1 gene in an attempt to increase copper tolerance. CUP1 encodes a metallothionein protein that binds 11 copper atoms, thereby preventing formation of the ROS. In addition, metallothionein detoxifies hydroxyl radicals with its cysteine groups."

"Abstract":"'Every 7 seconds one person dies from diabetes' (IDF, 2014). Among others, Type 1 Diabetes is the result of a partial or complete lack of insulin production that leads to deregulation of glucose levels in blood. Current available solutions for this disorder are based on complicated and expensive devices of external use.  We propose the use of an innovative system based on the construction of a bacterial sensor capable to respond to glucose concentrations; secondly this sensor aims to induce the production of insulin according to glucose levels. The bacteria are going to be contained in a modular device composed by contention, communication, extraction and change sections.  For the design of the device, a bio-compatible material was searched. This device is designed specifically to prevent an immune response of the patient. The system designed combines mechanical engineering and biotechnology, ensuring an appropriate and secure insulin dosage for the patient."

Is a big problem in developing countries and for over 70 years several attempts to create an effective vaccines have failed; the way to prevent  disease is to control vectors: Aedes aegypti. There are at least 4 different virus serotypes which prevalence shifts every year,  patients who suffered one particular serotype become immune for life, but getting another serotype, reaction is so severe that dengue becomes hemorrhagic and lethal most of the times.    We designed synthetic proteins aimed to produce immunological response against dengue. Using databases and for proteins, epitopes and 3D structures programs we found epitopes for L and T white cells. Then selected a protein and inserted on its chain these epitopes from all serotypes, and 4 proteins containing just one serotype."

We designed four novel glucose-sensitive promoters and tested their ability to drive expression of reporter chromoproteins at various glucose concentrations. In conjunction with existing glucose sensitive promoters from the Parts Registry, we used our novel promoters to design a biological device  that expresses different combinations of the three different chromoproteins in response to glucose in Escherichia coli. As such, this device can detect a larger dynamic range of concentrations of selected molecules (e.g., glucose). Our project aims to provide a cheaper alternative for diabetics than current, more expensive, glucose-monitoring systems. While driven by this initial problem, continuing work has shown that our approach may have its greatest potential as a more general molecular sensing platform, capable of being easily customized for the sensing of a broad range of relevant compounds."

Typically, MFCs exploit complex mixtures of microorganisms in which the identity of the microorganisms are unknown. The undefined nature of the source of electrons leads to limitations in the control and optimization of the MFC. We, therefore, attempted to improve the MFC platform by exclusively using E. coli engineered to survive under stressful conditions. E. coli cells were modified to express a light-driven proton pump, which required the assembly of a cofactor synthesis pathway. The proton gradient generated upon the exposure of light was then used by the bacteria to synthesize ATP, thereby turning E. coli into a type of pseudo-autotroph. Furthermore we investigated different genetic approaches to improve the secretion of electrons from E. coli. We built an MFC prototype with our engineered bacteria that are driven by light, which we called 'Solar pMFC.'"

However, this approach does not explain many complex and finely-tuned phenomena in the cell. We believe that a special genetic network, known as a 'tri-stable switch,' can model cell differentiation. This network would allow a cell to 'specialize' from a quasi-pluripotent state to one of two differentiated states. By repurposing native transcription factors, we can build such a switch in the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker's yeast. If this network can indeed achieve tri-stability, it may give us insight on the mechanisms of differentiation in stem cells, and bring us a step closer to construction synthetic stem cells in the lab."

"Abstract":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are produced by various activities, from grilling meat to coal gasification, and are potent carcinogens. Our project aims to degrade PAHs in industrial waste. The current waste handling method for PAHs is simply to deposit them in landfills where they leak into environment. Our cells need to detect the PAHs for the degradation. But the molecules do not readily pass through the membrane. We solved this predicament by using one of the smaller PAHs as an indicator to degrade the heavier PAHs.  The degradation of this small PAH inside the cell relieves repression of genes under the control of the NahR/Psal promoter system. This causes a series of enzymes to get expressed and secreted outside the cell, oxidising and cleaving the ring structures of the carcinogenic compounds, making them available for downstream bio-degradation. To increase the degradation efficiency our system also produces rhamnolipids."

We therefore reconstructed a Turing system using two advantages of synthetic biology; controllability and biological directness.

For diabetics, complications resulting from PGSs are the leading cause of death. Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes. This system is a safer alternative to dosage-dependent drug therapies to stabilize blood sugar levels."

The enzyme renders the MCs harmless by modifying their structure. "

DNA will be used to encode the information of points and pathways on the map, and log into the bio-navigation database. In this way, each feasible solution can be obtained by the corresponding biochemical operation. Because of the high parallelism of the DNA calculation, the solution is rapid. Then by selecting the feasible solutions, finally determine the optimal solution. Compared with AHUT_China 2014's project, BIO-COMPASS 2.0 has added identification site, path length, and adjacent site number information into the DNA sequence used for path expressing. Besides, Quaternary has been applied in our calculation to optimize the data extraction methods.

Treatment options for HCC are limited and often inefficient. Circular RNAs(CircRNA) belongs to the family of noncoding RNAs. They play a role in gene expression regulation and act as miRNA sponge. Recently, it was found that their levels are deregulated in various types of cancer. Using bioinformatics analysis, we have identified certain circular RNAs that are down regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma.  So, we are aiming to design a system that can sense CircRNA deregulation in the HCC and respond in a way to restore the balance and equilibrium in the CircRNA environment of the cancer cells. Also, we are evaluating the therapeutic effect  of CircRNA as a potential novel target for the treatment of HCC. "

One of the main uses of platinum is in cars' catalytic converters, hence important concentrations have been accumulated over time in soils next to roads.  Our goal is to recover this platinum as much as possible and obtain nanoparticles, in two steps. The first stage relies on the affinity of Desferrioxamine B, a siderophore, to bind platinum and so favor the further solubilisation of more platinum compounds. Secondly, a modified FliC protein complex will be cloned into E. coli and enable the biosorption of platinum on the flagella of the bacterium. "

"Description": "Strategies for blocking propagation of supercoiling generated during transcription",
"Abstract": "Construction of complex circuits is still hampered by ignorance of fundamental principles of genetic circuit design. One key challenge is the isolation of independent genetic components -- genes expressed on the same plasmid (or other DNA molecule) will often unexpectedly interfere with or enhance each others' expression in an orientation-dependent fashion, even if they are nominally isolated by terminators and other motifs. This form of cross-talk may be caused by supercoiling generated during transcription, which has been shown to enhance or repress gene expression depending on the form of supercoiling. To test this hypothesis, we will test whether base pair spacing, terminators, or  DNA \"clamps\" (made from DNA-binding proteins) placed between genes on a plasmid can eliminate their cross-talk. If DNA clamps do isolate nearby transcriptional units, then those clamps may advance the field of synthetic biology by allowing bioengineers to build more predictable genetic circuitry. "

"Abstract": "Many bacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate group behaviors, such as bioluminescence and virulence, by sending and receiving small molecules called homoserine lactones (HSLs). Bioengineers have incorporated QS networks into genetic circuits, using HSLs to connect logical operations. However, higher-order genetic circuitry is inhibited by “crosstalk,” in which one QS network responds to HSLs produced by another network. In addition to making it challenging to engineer with multiple QS networks, crosstalk has the dangerous potential to activate virulence pathways in pathogenic bacteria. Using a system that decouples “Senders” from “Receivers,” we are exploring how QS networks from different species behave and which networks have crosstalk. Our project adds 21 new plasmids for QS-based communication, including 12 novel QS proteins, to the iGEM Registry, helps to deepen the knowledge of bacterial communication, explores biosafety implications of engineering with HSLs, and empowers bioengineers to build more complex genetic circuits.

It is frequently used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and clothing fibres, especially in Japan. As avid users of PET-based products, our team decided to research how to optimise the degradation of PET, which takes an average of 450 years to degrade naturally. We were further inspired to pursue this goal with Keio University’s recent discovery of Ideonella sakaiensis — a unique bacteria capable of PET degradation. Thus, we have focused our project on the synthesis of an optimal PETase biobrick, which would be included in the iGEM database. Ultimately, our goal is to find an ideal promoter to expedite the production and secretion of PETase.  "

One common problem producers face is ethanol overproduction by Lachancea fermentati, making the kombucha alcoholic. This study screens L. fermentati using YPD agar plates with bromothymol blue, which changes color with changes in acidity. The color change allows for low-ethanol producing colonies to be selected for and recapitulated into the microbial community. Another issue for some would-be consumers is the taste of kombucha. By codon-optimizing an Arabadopsis gene for bacteria, Gluconobacter and Gluconoacetobacter can be transformed to produce brazzein, a sweet-tasting protein, thus sweetening the kombucha. Furthermore, these chassis organisms will be transformed with a GFP gene and pH-activated promoter to create a time-lapse of the changes that kombucha’s microbial community undergoes. "

In order to investigate if this is possible, we obtained the two enzymes used in Ideonella Sakaiensis, PETase and MHETase, and inserted the enzymes into E. coli plasmids.

Our goal is to improve biodegradation solutions using synthetic biology tools, from force evolution of a polyethylene degrading bacterium, through protein engineering of PET degrading enzyme, to genetically engineering a metabolic pathway that will enable our selected bacteria to consume PET as a sole carbon source.  Moreover, utilizing the high energy stored in PET, electrons released from PET oxidation will be immediately harnessed at an anode of a biofuel cell for electricity production.

"Abstract": "Bacterial Microcompartments (BMCs) are naturally occurring, protein-based containers within bacteria that sequester enzymes for particular reaction pathways. BMCs have numerous potential applications, including increasing flux of desired reactions or as targeted drug delivery vehicles. We have re-engineered the ethanolamine utilization BMC with a light inducible open/close switch by introducing the non-canonical amino acid azobenzene into the coat protein of the compartment, enabling the BMC to switch conformation upon light induction. Structural modeling combined with site-directed mutagenesis enabled predictive placement of azobenzene within the structure to induce large-scale rearrangements of the protein shell that allows the compartment to break apart and re-form in response to a “light switch”. This work expands the synthetic biology toolkit by presenting an outline for the engineering of synthetic BMCs that respond to external stimuli, enabling future biologists to utilize these compartments for controlled synthetic reactions.

"Abstract": "Dwindling fuel resources and rising environmental concerns have catalyzed the development of biofuel production in microorganisms. In Nova Scotia, softwood waste from the lumber industry is an untapped source for low-cost biofuel feedstock; however, this waste cannot be utilized by traditional biofuel processes due to toxic compounds such as turpentines and unavailable carbon compounds such as cellulose. The porcupine microbiome provides a unique solution as it is capable of digesting bark and toxic products. Working with Schubenacadie Wildlife Park, we aim to not only identify cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading bacteria in the porcupine microbiome, but to also characterize microbial communities found within the Park’s mammal population. To achieve these goals, we are using fecal samples to construct a DNA library of the porcupine and to analyze each mammal’s microbial rRNA. Future experiments include introducing identified cellulose and/or turpentine-degrading pathways into E. coli to produce an economically viable and sustainable biofuel-generating organism.    "

Unrefrigerated oxytocin has a half-life of ~3 minutes, and only 8% of samples tested in a 2012 study in Ghana were kept at the appropriate temperature. Expired, low-quality, and unavailable medications are common occurrences throughout the developing world, but little is known about the impact on maternal outcomes due in part to the lack of low-cost diagnostic tests.

"Abstract": "We are currently consuming resources faster than our planet can replenish them, thus it is obvious that we need to rethink resource efficiency in the future. In order to achieve high resource efficiency in biotechnology, the employment of sustainable substrates in industrial processes is imperative. Due to recent developments in biotechnology, it is now both possible and desirable to use non-conventional chassis, rather than relying on traditional organisms. We propose using the yeast Yarrowia Lipolytica as an alternative chassis, as it has an unusually broad substrate range as well as great potential for the production of both proteins and metabolic products. Due to the limited tools available, thus far the use of Y. lipolytica has been limited to research. Our project aims to develop both molecular and bioinformatic tools for Y. lipolytica, in order to introduce the organism as an advantageous chassis for future bio-refineries. "

"Abstract": "Taxol, generically known as paclitaxel, is a chemotherapy drug highly efficient in combating multiple forms of cancer via interference with the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division.   Deriving taxol from nature is environmentally unsustainable because the bark of the tree it is harvested from, the Pacific yew, grows too slowly to meet demands for taxol. Chemically synthesis is economically unsustainable because the intricate stereoisomerism and multistep pathway of taxol production result in low yield rates and high production costs.  Manufacturing taxol via biosynthesis remedies the shortcomings of both aforementioned production methods; the need for the yew tree is circumvented and production cost is exponentially lower compared to the cost of chemical synthesis.   Duke iGEM is optimizing the biosynthesis of taxol in E.coli by individually characterizing and then consolidating enzymes of the taxol biosynthesis pathway into a single strain for fermentation of taxol.

To achieve this, we’ve created a fusion protein which will allow our spiRNA to hitch a ride out of E. coli. Then the agent will sneak its way into the target pathogen and complete its mission by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection. We’re targeting Cholera and Shigella specifically because they are both a major cause of death in developing countries, this is because treatments are not readily available and are often expensive. Therefore, we hope our spiRNA is a cheaper alternative to current treatments that will hopefully be readily available to a larger number of infected people and in other words FIGHT BACTERIAL INFECTIONS.

Today, the bacterium Escherichia coli remains the model organism in molecular biology. Due to the need for expensive equipment, work is limited to well-funded laboratories. To address this issue and extend research to modestly-funded settings, we propose Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 as an alternative vehicle that harnesses E. coli’s transformative powers while obviating the need for costly apparatus. A reporter gene, E. coli gusA was ligated into each of our shuttle vectors; the ligation mixtures were used to transform A. baylyi. Transformed cells formed blue colonies on media containing histochemical substrate X-gluc, indicating that A. baylyi can be used instead of E. coli particularly when refrigerated centrifuges and ultra-cold freezers are unavailable. We hope our findings can enable genetic engineering in modestly-funded laboratories and bring more diversity to the field of synthetic biology.   "

Current diagnostic methods are invasive and rely on biomarkers that are not sufficiently disease-specific.  We have engineered E. coli to detect several disease-specific biomarkers, memorize this event, and allow specific readout of the memory state.   While the sensor cells travel through the gut, simultaneously occurring signals are memorized by activating an AND gate which triggers a recombination-based unidirectional switch and commits the observation to memory. After isolation from the patient’s faeces, the memory can be read out through the expression of a fluorescent protein induced by the addition of the candidate biomarker. Thus a single fluorescent protein can differentiate between many different candidate markers. A community of sensor cells can be utilized at the same time, enabling a high degree of multiplexing. Pavlov’s Coli is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for a large selection of specific biomarkers associated with IBD.   "

Current strategies on targeted drug delivery are mainly based on the applications of antibody-drug conjugates or nanoparticles. However, both approaches revealed considerable challenges in their application due to short half-life and expensive production, respectively. We develop a novel platform for targeted drug delivery by  implementing highly specific nanobodies directed against surface markers of affected cells. The combination with an enzymatic functionality facilitates the local activation of prodrugs, thus preventing unnecessary side effects by systemic drug dispersal.

The tetracyclin repressor protein is produced using an arabinose inducible promoter and the colicin gene is behind a tetracyclin repressible promoter.

"Abstract": "Our team aims at engineering a biological tri-stable switch which shows high orthogonality as bistable switch in Escherichia coli. Building on the Brown 2006 and 2007 iGEM teams’ design, the tri-stable switch which consists of three alternating steady states that can be toggled by three different chemical inducers is improved. The construct was constructed with three promoters, lacp, phlFp and an ameliorated version of tetp together with their corresponding repressors. This combination enables the switch acting more stably by preventing it from reverting back to its natural states. Mathematical analysis was performed to ensure a stable and robust behaviour of the switch. Being orthogonal and more stable, the tri-stable switch could be applied in different fields, like biosensing and biocomputing. If the system is further studied and developed, it is foreseeable that it could contribute to the mature integration of different circuits in the future.  "

"Abstract": "Inspired by the ability of horsehair worm modifying the behavior of other organisms, we would like to employ the idea to modify organisms behavior by what available in our laboratory.   Nematode is a pest, which will attack the roots of crops. We wish to modify its behavior by engineering bacteria to produce biochemical cues to attract or repel the worm. We identified two potential biochemicals, cinnamaldehyde and phenylpyruvic acid, which are possibly attractant or repellent to the Nematode.   We have designed a chemosensation assay to demonstrate the attraction and repulsion ability of the biochemical of interest. The results suggest that cinnamaldehyde is a strong repellent and phenylpyruvic acid is a moderate attractant to the worm. Genetic engineering of bacteria to produce the two biochemicals are working in progress.  "

Although there are a few methods (for example: ICP-MS) to detect these harmful substances, the procedures often turn out to be expensive and inconvenient to most people. If the danger in herbs continues to cast shadows among people, it is only a matter of time that people stop eating Chinese Medicine and soon this important Chinese culture might be gone forever. Thus, we decide to create a series of cheap, user-friendly E. coli biosensor. When the bacteria detect certain poison in the medicine, they will produce fluorescence protein. That way, we can detect the poison inside the Chinese Medicine by just examining the fluorescence intensity. With this new design and aspect, we hope to see people regaining hope in this tradition, yet, this distinctive culture. "

Most significantly, the positive feedback regulation system can transform an input pulse into stable output. So it can be applied in circuits as signal filter, which is very useful to many applications, such as treatment to lactose intolerance.

Eventually, the shape of the colony matches the preset pattern we want and thus a “what you see is what you get” platform for the study of bio-pattern formation is obtained.

The infrastructure and running costs for the downstream processing are significant obstacles to the large scale adoption of bio-manufacturing, especially for small-scale start-ups that drive innovation. We have therefore developed a modular set of tools by designing BioBricksTM for E. coli that firstly cause programmed induction of product synthesis upon reaching a certain tuneable population of cells, and secondly, autoaggregate the cells upon utilization of most of the nutrients available; these eliminate external induction and centrifugation, thereby minimizing costs. This is of special importance in India, where financial constraints often bottleneck entrepreneurial efforts in biotechnology, which is still a field in the early stages of its development.  "

As a result, the plasmid can be amplified in both E. coli and Bifidobacterium, and apoptin can be expressed in Bifidobacterium. The Bifidobacterium transformed with this plasmid can settle in the tumor regions, and secret the apoptin protein, which is specifically toxic to tumor cells. With the TAT-mediated membrane crossing, apoptin should be able to enter into solid tumor cells and kill tumor cells.  "

The data will be gathered using a device that can quantify the color of the light reflected by the chromoprotein before and after induction.

"Abstract": "Blood clotting is controlled by a highly regulated pathway that attempts to ensure a balance between clotted and unclotted blood within a wound. As a response to trauma, enzymes in the pathway activate sequentially to convert fibrinogen into fibrin.The fibrin strands cross-link together to form a polymer mesh that causes blood flow to slow and eventually cease at the wound site. However, without external intervention the natural clotting process is too slow to prevent excessive hemorrhage and death when bleeding is severe. Proteins in some snake venoms have the ability to act as thrombin analogues and induce the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin at an accelerated rate, bypassing the regulatory pathway. The increased concentration of fibrin causes clots to form quickly within the bloodstream. Our goal is to utilize recombinant protein from Cerastes cerastes venom to prevent fatal hemorrhage and minimize thrombosis in cases of traumatic injury.  "

Chronic wounds are unable to heal in an orderly set of stages or within a time period of about three months. The etiology of chronic wounds is very diverse, but patients frequently suffer from persisting chronic wounds due to their bodies overproducing wound site proteases. In turn, these proteases decrease wound healing rates by degrading host growth factors and the extracellular matrix of the wound site.

Our proposed prototype, AlcoPatch, is based on studies that demonstrate the correlation between sweat and blood ethanol concentrations. Our AlcoPatch utilizes Escherichia coli as a chassis to engineer two different devices which would generate visible colour changes according to sweat ethanol concentrations. The first is a cell-free mechanism that uses alcohol oxidase, derived from Pichia pastoris, to initiate redox chain reactions required for the colour conversion of indicator dyes. The second manipulates an ethanol-inducible gene-switch system, derived from Aspergillus nidulans, to regulate the expression of chromoproteins. To guide our experiments, we use an innovative ensemble modelling approach to account for the uncertainty in our parameters. This enables us to predict the most cost-effective design options for prototyping.     "

"Abstract": "Globalization radically changed the world we live in; the way we communicate and travel has become much easier. On the downside, our need for resources has dramatically increased causing ecological and social problems like land-grabbing and fracking. The emergence of Synthetic Biology is initiating another bio-based industrial revolution. It is time to take the next step towards a sustainable bio-industry. In 'Syndustry', we follow nature’s own design principles by combining the strengths of individual microorganisms for the production of valuable biochemicals. We introduce a novel ‘plug-and-play’ production platform based on artificial endosymbiosis. This system goes beyond co-culturing microbes and overcomes current production limitations in fermentation. By employing cyanobacteria, capable of photosynthetic growth, we achieve a self-sustainable and versatile production platform for biochemicals from carbon dioxide.  'Syndustry – fuse. produce. use.' is the next industrial revolution and will change the face of the world as we know it today!   "

"Abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers have the highest cancer mortality rate in Canada due to difficulties in tumour diagnosis and treatment. Common anti-cancer therapies used today can lack specificity and have off-target effects, damaging the body in the process. Our focus is to engineer commensal Lactobacillus bacteria to bind and aggregate towards Her2+ GI tumours. Membrane-anchored binding proteins specific to Her2 will be engineered into Lactobacillus to redirect bateria for aggregation at the tumour site. With sufficient bacterial density, a quorum sensing mechanism triggers production of a vital T cell activating cytokine, interleukin-2 (IL-2), to recruit tumour-specific T cells for an anti-cancer response. Simulations of the bacteria in a possible tumour environment will help drive quorum-sensing design (e.g. promoter sensitivity). Ethical concerns were addressed through research into the feasibility of such a treatment, particularly into methods to minimize health risks, make the treatment financially accessible, and abide relevant legislation.

Star-like peptides are an existing concept and have been demonstrated experimentally to have potential uses in augmenting enzyme reaction kinetics and improving performance of antimicrobial peptides. We aim to improve and optimise the design, primarily with the addition of split inteins. These are a special type of protein sequence which allow each arm of the peptide to be ligated to another protein of choice, which could be an enzyme or even other StarScaffold units. We are focusing primarily on two main applications for the StarScaffold; as a hydrogel with uniquely customisable physical and biochemical properties, and as a method of improving enzyme reaction kinetics. These technologies are currently growing in popularity and we hope our project can help improve the current state of the science. "

Experimental practices may differ immensely across laboratories and precise details of these practices may be lost or forgotten as skilled faculty or students leave the lab to pursue other endeavors. Furthermore, there are few well-defined protocols that are generally agreed upon by the scientific community, in part due to the lack of a system that can supply a measure of a protocol’s acceptance. In order to address these problems, we set out to build a database that integrates a crowd-sourced ratings and comments system to serve as a protocol curator that enables wet lab investigators to compare various protocol efficacies, quantify a protocol’s acceptance within the scientific community, and provide an avenue through which experiential knowledge can be communicated.

We decided to oxidize alcohol and produce hydrogen peroxide to cause exchanging of electrons then detect it by blood glucose meters. Our bacteria will produce alcohol oxidase and display it on the cell surface, and we will remove the glucose oxidase in a blood glucose meter and replace it with alcohol oxidase. Voila!

"Abstract": "Gene drives induce biased inheritance of specific genes and are currently being considered as a method to regulate mosquito populations. However, the ability of gene drives to spread quickly through entire populations raises serious ethical concerns, especially when the genetic change affects reproduction. To address this issue, we constructed both a gene drive and an inducible recovery drive and modeled the combined system using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our gene drive results in deletion of both copies of the ADE2 gene from S. cerevisiae using the CRISPR/Cas system, causing the yeast to turn red. As a safety mechanism, we constructed a tetracycline-inducible recovery drive to counteract the function of our gene drive. The recovery drive restores the ADE2 gene allowing S. cerevisiae to return to its original color. Our gene/recovery drive system advances foundational work towards controlling global pests and invasive species, protecting information stored in DNA, and various other important applications.  "

These growths, called endometrial lesions, cause severe chronic pain and infertility. Because the only definitive diagnostic method is laparoscopic surgery, patients wait on average seven years between the onset of symptoms and an accurate diagnosis.   The goal of the MIT iGEM team’s project is to expedite this diagnosis process with a genetic circuit that can sense the unique biomarkers of endometriosis. Our circuit identifies whether cells are diseased by checking the cells’ miRNA profiles and by sensing progesterone resistance, a hallmark of endometriosis. This identification process can be implemented in endometrial biopsy samples, eliminating the need for surgical diagnosis. Our approach could lead to a less invasive diagnostic method, enabling earlier treatment and improving patient outcomes.  "

If large-scale operations for photosynthetic production of industrial compounds are to be realized, robustness to unpredictable weather conditions must be considered. Two complementary approaches are being proposed to increase cold adaptation and resistance to freezing in S. elongatus. Previously, it was shown the expression of lipid desaturase desA increases the cold-growth tolerance of S. elongatus. We now aim to improve this range by fine-tuning the expression of a riboswitch-controlled desA. We also hypothesize that introduction of SFR2 from Arabidopsis thaliana—responsible for remodeling the outer chloroplast membrane for increased freezing tolerance—will increase cellular viability to freezing events. Through this two-pronged approach, we aspire to engineer a cyanobacterial strain that ultimately could be used for the production of industrially-relevant products in unreliable environment conditions.

These bacteria synthesize magnetosomes covered by phospholipid bilayer membrane, in which Mms13 is tightly anchored.

In the presence of a specific gRNA guide, the tCas9 domain from CIB1-tCas9 binds to the promoter of a reporter gene. Once exposing to blue light, the CRY2 domain from CRY2-VP64 can form a protein complex with CIB1-tCas9, which in turn brings the VP64 domain to the chromatin and activates the reporter gene.

A kill switch will be activated when there is insufficient lactate present, thus minimising non-specific targeting.

Our project aims to develop a portable, consumer-focused device to detect the presence of SLT in foods. Our device focuses on detecting the interaction between the Gb3 receptor, produced by E. coli Gb3 synthase, and the non-toxic component of SLT, Subunit B. The performance of SDS-PAGE will allow consumers to compare the migration patterns of Subunit B crosslinked with Gb3 to positive and negative controls and identify the presence of SLT.  "

"Description": "BreaKERs: Developing bacterial Keratinases for use in wastewater treatment and poultry industries ",
"Abstract": "An estimated 8.5 billion tons of poultry feathers are produced from farms globally every year, in addition to the tons of human hair that are removed from wastewater treatment facilities worldwide.  Keratin waste is typically disposed of through incineration, burying the waste, or mechanical processing that yields low-quality protein products.  All these processes take their toll on the environment.  However, Keratinase is a serine protease that primarily attacks the disulfide bonds in keratin waste—such as feathers and hair.  Thus, the expression of bacterial keratinases provides an opportunity to manage this degradation-resistant keratin waste and turn it into a high quality protein product such as fertilizer or animal feed.  \tTo do this, two Keratinase Genes isolated from the Bacillus genera are used.  Keratinase A (kerA) is more active in degrading keratin in feathers, while Keratinase US (kerUS) is most effective in degrading the keratin in hair.    "

"Abstract": "Generally, stem-loops forming polynucleotides are more stable than the single-stranded ones. Particularly, mRNA with a stem-loop at its 3'- or 5'-end often has a longer half-life than their linear counterpart owing to the stem loops' resistance to exoribonucleases. Our team designed a polycistron gene expression construct, in which each gene followed by a stem-loop and an endoribonuclease cleavage site. When it is transcribed, digested by the endoribonuclease, and cleaved into independent mRNAs with different stem-loops, different mRNA shows different stability, determined by the designed Gibbs free energy (∆G) of their stem-loops, resulting in different expression level of their encoded proteins. In this way, we decouple the gene expression level of the same operon simply by designing different stem-loops. In addition, by quantitatively adjusting the free energy of the stem-loops, we can even achieve a stoichiometry expression of the target proteins precisely, like playing a beautiful concerto of cistrons.

"Abstract": "Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder in which the body is unable to fully metabolise copper. This results in copper accumulation, causing liver and brain damage if untreated. Patients describe current treatments as unsatisfactory due to their costliness, side effects, and dosage frequency.  We hope to show that E. coli engineered to express copper chelators originating from M. trichosporium and Mycobacterium spp. reduces copper ion concentration in vitro. This has applications as a potential probiotic treatment for Wilson’s disease, without the limitations of current treatments. We propose an encapsulation system that protects bacteria from simulated stomach conditions and may serve as a mechanism to deliver the probiotic to the small intestine, the site of copper absorption.

However, recent observations suggest that the expression of genes can also be affected by their spatial localization due to chromatin conformation. Our project aims at testing this hypothesis and determining if the expression of genes under the control of promoters of different strengths can be affected by their spatial proximity. We thus designed a new adaptable tool composed of two different dCas9s fused with the FRB / FKBP12 dimerization system (induced by rapamycin) to increase the spatial proximity of two different DNA regions. We also designed a tool composed of two dCas9s and a tripartite split-GFP to visualize the spatial proximity of these two DNA regions.  Altogether, these tools offer new perspectives for gene expression control and visualization of the spatial proximity of chromosomal regions.  "

Nevertheless, these methods are flawed owing to high cost, lengthy procedures as well as potential secondary contamination. To overcome the drawbacks of traditional methods, Peking iGEM team focus on constructing a novel multi-functional biological material which is able to absorb uranyl ion fleetly with high specificity and affinity. This uranyl-absorbing material can be synthesized and secreted continuously by bacteria, self-assembled in extracellular environment, and harvested in a cost-effective manner. It also has a great potential to be modified and expanded due to its modular design. With this material, we demonstrate how the increasingly serious uranium pollution can be treated in a more efficient and sustainable way in the near future.  "

Our aim is to produce a portable, quick and easy to use Biosensor device for environmental law enforcement agencies and even consumers that can detect for levels of carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen in vehicle exhausts and express corresponding chromoproteins as a result. The system is based on two separate gas-sensing mechanisms that work together to give a range of results. The mechanism sensing for carbon monoxide uses the CooA transcription factor and two CooA dependent promoters: CooF and CooM. The NOx sensing mechanism uses the NsrR repressed promoters, YeaR and NirK, as well as the NorV promoter. "

Current detection devices for thallium are sophisticated laboratory instruments that are inappropriate for use by the general public. Thus, we are developing a paper-based sensor for use at home to determine if drinking water needs further analysis for thallium levels. Our sensor detects thallium using a specific DNAzyme, which activates an oligonucleotide input for a genetically encoded toehold switch. Activating the switch leads to the expression of a reporter gene, which is easily detected. The DNAzyme sensor makes the circuit adaptable to other metals. The coupled genetic circuit is inexpensive to produce and also holds promise for signal amplification to improve the detection limit of the system. Finally, embedding the device on a paper substrate will provide the general population with a simple way to test the safety of drinking water. "

In this project, DNA aptamers were designed and evaluated as low-cost biological linkers to tether plant photosystem II (PSII) complexes to graphene foam electrodes.  Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), together with software developed by team Heidelberg 2015 (MAWS and JAWS) were used to develop PSII- and graphene-binding DNA aptamer candidates. This project aims to improve the attachment and orientation of the PSII complex to the graphene electrode for higher electron transfer efficiency, and serves as a prototype for the in planta expression of RNA aptamers for self-assembling thylakoid attachment.

These products are great lead compounds but often possess poor pharmacokinetics or high toxicity. NRPS can incorporate non-standard amino acids, and have the ability to append unique substituents onto their product. These factors make optimizing lead compounds extremely difficult through synthetic chemistry. Using nature as our guide along with the tools of synthetic biology we will be modifying NRPS at the DNA-level to improve the properties of lead compounds. We will be introducing tools to capture large NRPS gene clusters, append chemical modifications onto products, and screen NRPS production in a high throughput fashion.

Its ability to grow and replicate utilizing aerobic respiration or fermentation, and its ability to survive without functional mitochondria, provide opportunities to control or alter mitochondrial function to optimize production processes or develop novel cellular subsystems in the mitochondrial space. To begin exploring these opportunities, we adapted two commonly used yeast expression vectors to the RFC 10 standard and used them to express yEGFP preceded by the mitochondrial localization signal from the mitoribosomal protein mRPS12. In addition, we attempted to demonstrate that aerobic respiration can be controlled by manipulating the expression of mRPS12.  Without mRPS12, yeast mitochondria lack a functioning ribosome and become unable to produce proteins necessary for aerobic respiration.  By expressing the mRPS12 protein in a haploid mRPS12 knockout strain, we investigated its usefulness as a means of regulating aerobic respiration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. "

Interestingly, dye motifs are produced in cyanobacteria in the form of tetrapyrollic dyes motifs including; heme, chlorophyll and phycocyanobilin (PCB), where PCB proteins have also been utilized in immunoassay kits. In fact, the biosynthesis of PCB is an attractive pathway to manipulate owing to the potential to prepare a myriad of tetrapyrrollic derivatives. These derivatives, have been studied extensively for light-based applications and the ability to genetically direct the bacterial synthetic machinery would be significantly beneficial towards CO2 sequestration, and the production of low-cost dyes.

We can then measure the concentration of penicillin by measuring the fluorescence intensity on the plate. To even further reduce the cost and strengthen the sensitivity of the test, we create a test paper by binding our fusion protein CBD (cellulose binding domain)-PBP5 to filter paper.

Over-prescription of antibiotics is a major issue promoting antibiotic resistance. We have designed a device that aims to rapidly distinguish bacterial infections, thereby preventing mis-prescription of antibiotics.  In the war for iron, bacteria produce siderophores that scavenge Fe3+ from blood. In response, the immune system produces lipocalin-2 which sequesters siderophores. Lipocalin-2 levels can increase 5-fold during a bacterial infection. Our device detects this difference by utilising Fur, an iron-dependant repressor regulating levels of RyhB which acts as an inverter repressing GFP, our reporter protein. Therefore, bacterial infection results in a weak GFP signal in contrast to a strong signal in patients without bacterial infection. With our device, we potentially have the capability of rapidly determining the presence of any bacterial infection, enabling us to combat the mis-prescription of antibiotics.   "

Chronic skin wounds are characterized by poor re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and granulation. SDF (topical stromal cell-derived growth factor-1), though found effective to re-epithelialization, is rapidly degraded by high levels of protease around wounds. To solve this issue, we fuse SDF1 to ELP(elastin-like peptides) that can aggregate to form nanoparticles so to prevent against proteolysis and promote neovascularization, resulting in much faster re-epithelialization of chronic skin wounds.  We also add an antimicrobial peptide LL-37 to avoid infection by preventing a wide range of bacteria growth. To enable our health care taker to be used by everyone, we devise a super-convenient product which only needs 4 simple steps “AAPH”( Add. Add. Press.

"Abstract": "The worldwide Cancer death in the year 2012 was around 8.2 million and,by 2030,13 million deaths are predicted. As per existing records 60% of the rural people in India think that Cancer detection and cure, costs an arm and a leg and is time consuming.  MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript1) is associated with around 15 different types of Cancer. The elevated expression of this gene is correlated with the poor overall survival of the patients. In our project, we strived to develop a minimally invasive Cancer diagnostic chip to enable cost and time efficient detection. The MALAT1 was amplified using E.Coli Plasmids. The chip is equipped with markers to produce fluorescence when encountered with the sample containing MALAT1. Based on its intensity range, particular stage of Cancer can be detected and suitable treatment can be provided. The developed diagnostic chip will revolutionize the so followed Cancer detection techniques.  "

"Abstract": " Atmospheric exploration, both on Earth and beyond, requires putting instrumentation into those atmospheres. Traditionally balloons have been ideal tools for atmospheric research: to track weather patterns, wind patterns, and to monitor atmospheric composition. Our team is working to create a completely biological balloon that is light, that is potentially biodegradable, and that can be both continuously and sustainably produced. To make the balloon itself, we are engineering bacteria to produce membrane polymers with different properties. To inflate the balloon, we are using algae to produce biological hydrogen to fill the balloon. To increase balloon durability, we are looking for biological ways to make our materials radiation resistant. Finally, to functionalize our balloon we are creating biological temperature and small molecule sensors. When combined to form a biological balloon these projects could create a completely novel category of scientific instrument: cheap, light, durable, and useful. "

"Abstract": "Chronic wounds are an increasing burden to global health; 1-2% of individuals in Europe and the US will be affected in their lifetime by an injury which heals poorly, or not at all. Current treatments rely heavily on antibiotics and debridement of the wound’s biofilm which have proven to be ineffective and contribute to widespread antibiotic resistance. iGEM Team Stockholm 2016 aims to tackle these issues with a novel spider-silk-based wound healing technology.  Spider silk, a biodegradable and non-immunogenic material, will serve as a scaffold for attachment of anti-microbial ‘combat enzymes’. They will be conjugated to the silk using a transpeptidase - Sortase A - and are intended to target key components of the biofilm formed by Staphylococcus aureus on wound surfaces. With this multi-targeted approach, we hope to develop a proof-of-concept system for the management of chronic wounds, envisioning future adaptations for a variety of medical and non-medical applications.

"Abstract": "Pancreatic cancer continues to have high mortality rates due the inefficiency of currently existing screening methods and treatments. Recent discoveries have demonstrated the heparan sulfate proteoglycan Glypican-1 (GPC1) as a more predictive biomarker for pancreatic cancer than the previously studied marker CA19-9. Additionally, GPC1 has been found to be present on exosomes in human blood serum before tumorigenesis. This project aims to use a biological system in S. cerevisiae to detect this biomarker via expression of the human Cripto-1(CR-1) transmembrane protein, a known binding partner of GPC1, as well as c-Src, a mitogen activated kinase. Binding of GPC1 to CR-1 leads to subcellular phosphorylation and activation of human c-Src kinase, resulting in downstream induction of the MAPK pathway. Through validated expression of CR-1 and increased phosphorylation of c-Src, this project aims to expand the potential for development of a non invasive biological sensor for early pancreatic cancer detection.

To achieve our goal, membrane mechanosensitive channels (TRPC5 and Piezo) are chosen as receptors. Fluorescent calcium indicator (R-GECO) is employed to indicate cytoplasmic calcium level. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and YFP are used as downstream indicators to quantify the regulatory abilities. Microfluidic channels are also utilized in the pre-study in which shear stress, similar to sound waves, is applied on the cell surface as signal input to explore the basic parameters. A sound generator is constructed to test whether sound can trigger the channels as expected. Additionally, we use directed evolution to improve channels' selectivity for specific sound frequency and their sensitivity to sound of lower intensity. "

"Abstract": "Cataracts, the clouding of the lens, cause half of the world's blindness. Most cataracts are age-related and arise when crystallin proteins in the lens become oxidized and aggregate over time. Surgery is currently the only recognized treatment to effectively cure cataracts, but this method is expensive and invasive. Therefore, we formulated a natural and non-invasive alternative. In the eye, a natural antioxidant glutathione (GSH)—produced by the enzyme glutathione reductase (GSR)—exists to combat oxidation, but GSH levels decrease with age. Studies have also suggested that another enzyme—25-hydroxylase (CH25H)—can convert cholesterol in the eye into 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which reverses crystallin aggregation. We expressed and purified GSR and CH25H for the prevention and treatment of cataracts, respectively. To deliver these proteins through the cornea and into the lens, we engineered biodegradable chitosan nanoparticles, thus creating a natural and non-invasive alternative to surgery.  "

The costs of proper collection and recycling of e-waste may exceed the revenues generated from the recovered materials, due to the complexity of separating them. We propose a synthetic biology approach in Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Chromobacterium violaceum to enhance metal recovery from e-waste in a three-step bioleaching process. First, the enzyme TetH will be overexpressed in A. thiooxidans in order to enhance leaching of copper, iron, and tin. Then, C. violaceum will leach gold and silver. Cyanide is responsible for this leaching activity, and the enzymes that produce it will be expressed under the control of a gold sensitive promoter. Overexpression of a cyanide-degrading enzyme will reduce toxicity. Implementing a voltaic cell in the final stage will allow precipitation of the previously recovered metals. "

TecCEM 2016 team is developing a novel, specific method to avoid Acinetobacter baumannii proliferation onto nonliving surfaces through cell wall lysis, as an alternative to current antimicrobials that promote antimicrobial resistance development. The use of endolysins ensures the elimination of the pathogen of interest, as specificity for Acinetobacter baumannii increases its efficiency.

The virus has been characterised and documented at the genetic and proteomic levels, but given its pathophysiology during infection, diagnosis at early stages is somewhat complicated and unusual, particularly because of the absence of symptoms. Moreover, it is of crucial importance as some HPV strains have been shown to correlate with oncogenic outcomes. TecCEM_HS 2016 is developing a rapid test method by using the novelties of riboswitch technology. With careful and appropriate design, bacteria could serve as a signal provider that may give insight into the viral presence by means of fluorescence.

It has been found that regenerating respiratory epithelial cells of CF patients carry the asialo-GM1 ganglioside. The binding of the B-subunit to its receptor molecules results in the internalization, probably by endocytosis, of the protein, together with its linked cargo plasmid.

In order to avoid a significant impact on growth rates we will select suitable knock-out targets based on an analysis of in silico models of closely related species. Since cloning is the main work in both our and most other iGEM projects, we want to make cloning faster, easier and cheaper. We will achieve this by creating backbone inserts for a new plasmid series, that will allow the use of negative selection and a novel plasmid purification technique with the iGEM 3A assembly. "

"Abstract": "This project aims to develop a delivery platform for the Cas9 genome-editing tool.  Cas9 is an RNA guided endonuclease that is revolutionizing the field of molecular biology and is now being applied to therapeutics for the site-specific modification of the genome.  One of the major challenges facing CRISPR-Cas9 technology is efficient intracellular delivery and nuclear localization.  To this end, we are producing a fusion protein of the NLS-tagged Cas9 endonuclease and an atoxic variant of the Clostridium difficile toxin B (aTcdB). The TcdB protein mediates cell penetration by binding extracellular epitopes, entering via endocytosis, and delivering the active toxin component through the endosome membrane. By expressing the Cas9 protein at the N-terminus, and knocking out the toxin’s active site residues, the pore-forming component of the aTcdB protein should facilitate intracellular delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing platform.

"Abstract": "As the field of synthetic biology increases and becomes more present in the everyday live the topic of bio safety becomes more important likewise. However, there are no functional safety approaches available from previous years that the teams could easily choose and apply on their current projects. To this end, we want to generate a safety approach to enable all iGEM Teams to work safely with E.coli.  A genetic circuit is integrated into the E.coli genome ensuring that genetically modified E.coli cannot survive outside of the required conditions. This genetic circuit is based on the availability of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) which continuously has to be added to the medium. A reporter protein is expressed as the level of UAA in the medium decreases, signalizing the low UAA concentration. If the level decreases further, the expression of colicin is induced, resulting in the death of the bacteria.  "

"Abstract": "This project aims to engineer Escherichia coli to make biological microlenses and lasers. To produce microlenses, we express the enzyme silicatein in our engineered cells, which catalyzes polymerization of silicic acid. This results in a biosilica layer around the cell, enabling it to function as a microlens. Additionally, we will create biological lasers to improve current imaging techniques by expressing fluorescent proteins within biosilica-covered cells. A fraction of the photons emitted by fluorescent proteins are trapped inside the cell by the biosilica layer. Once these photons hit other excited fluorescent proteins, stimulated emission occurs. This process results in light with a higher intensity and a narrower color spectrum compared to conventional fluorescence. With our research we hope to contribute to the wide range of applications in the field of bio-optics and enable environmentally friendly and economic production of microlenses with applications varying from smartphones to solar panels.

The modifications include changes in 5'UTR regions, likely ribosome binding sites and secondary structures to evaluate how those features affect translational machinery. We have also focused on open reading frame (ORF) optimization. Using bioinformatic analysis we have created sfGFP and mRFP variants composed exclusively of the most frequent or the rarest codons. We have also designed ORFs to control codon context effects and GC content for evaluation of their influence on translational effectiveness. "

However, current recycling methods consume vast amounts of energy and release toxic byproducts. Prior research has identified a number of enzyme classes that can efficiently replace the chemicals currently used in paper recycling. Despite their ability to facilitate the separation of ink particles from paper fibers, a process called deinking, enzymes have not been widely used industrially due to insufficient knowledge about efficiency and costly production and purification methods. In our project, we tackled these issues and took significant steps towards catalyzing research in the area and applying enzymatic paper recycling on an industrial scale. We developed a high throughput system which not only allows us to quantify deinking efficiency, but also to cheaply mass produce enzymes using a B. subtilis secretion system. "

It may be possible to restore circadian timing in animals transgenically using an oscillator network based on the KaiABC system, which consists of three core proteins that generate a 24-hour circadian clock endogenous to the cyanobacterium Synechocococcus elongatus. The Kai oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins, motivating a previous study to transplant it into E. coli (Chen et al, 2014). Successfully transplanting this dynamic system from prokaryotes to eukaryotes would represent an important step towards potential therapeutic treatment. Therefore, as a proof of concept, we aim to establish the KaiABC system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will attempt to drive cyclic expression of GFP and RFP on alternating 12-hour cycles, thus inducing circadian expression of two temporally separated protein products in a non-circadian eukaryotic organism.

We will use a directed evolution approach to mutate specific regions linked to the gate opening and subject the resulting mutants to strong specific selection pressure.

To this end, we intend to genetically manipulate P. putida to incorporate a synthetic genetic switch that will allow us to reprogram bacteria either to induce robust biofilm formation appropriate for biocatalysis, or biofilm dispersal to allow easy recycling of the substrate materials of the reactor. On the other hand, we will use in silico predictions to rationally modify carbon assimilation and metabolism to obtain conversion of glycerol into products of potential biotechnological use. "

"Abstract": "Microfluidics already allows us to scale down a wide range of experiments, streamlining and lowering their cost. Creating microfluidic chips can however be very expensive, since certain expertise and special equipment are required. Our goal was to develop a method of making microfluidics more available to iGEM teams and researchers, while also creating tools that could be combined with these chips. By 3D-printing the molds for the chips we were able to produce cheap, high resolution devices capable of transforming E.coli more efficiently than standard protocols for transformation. We also characterised and added to the registry the recently discovered CRISPR associated protein CPF1 as well as the fluorescent protein UnaG. As CPF1 has been shown to be more effective than CAS9 in certain aspects, and UnaG being half the size of GFP, we thought these proteins would greatly assist future iGEM teams, especially in combination with microfluidics!

"Abstract": "  A Martian colony must make efficient use of the planet’s limited resources. This project was inspired by the movie, “The Martian” and by the work of Davila et al (2013- Intl. J. Astrobiol) who proposed that toxic concentrations of perchlorate (ClO4) in Martian soil was a resource that could be exploited as a source of oxygen (O2), while remediating the soil in the process. Here we build on this work and others by: 1) testing the idea that that ClO4 can be highly enriched and concentrated inexpensively by selective ion exchange chromatography, 2) Converting ClO4 to O2 and Cl-  using a strain of E. coli that has been engineered to express perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase (two enzymes derived from the soil bacterium Ideonella dechloratans) and, 3) developing a method for the conversion of colony bio-waste into a highly enriched media for bacterial growth.

Alkanes are key components of petroleum diesel, however, biodiesel molecules produced by transesterification are oxygen-rich and combustion of these esters cause malfunction and corrosion in regular engines. The development of a biodiesel free of oxygen chemically similar to the petroleum based fuel is essential to expand the lifetime of engines using the concept of drop-in. A membrane resistant to fatty acids is important for using vegetal oils as the source material and this resistance will be provided by tocopherol. The USP-EEL-BRAZIL team  is composed of undergraduate and graduate students. In the long run term, the USP-EEL-BRAZIL team expects to develop a genetic circuit for Industrial biodiesel production. "

For immobilizing these biomolecules will be used gene recombination techniques, adding the polymerization domains  in the enzibiotic molecule, compatible with the spider silk proteins. Both will be produced in recombinant microalgae  by nuclear transformation of model microorganism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The project will be executed by group of undergraduates and graduate students in the context of iGEM. It is expected to achieve spider silk fiber production and its initial characterization for antimicrobial activity and mechanical properties, as well as the productivity evaluation in the proposed system.

We know that Sup35 aggregates between 37℃ and 42℃, and Guanidine Hydrochloride (GDNHCL) induces aggregated Sup35 to separate.     We decide to take advantage of three characters of Sup35: assembling, thermal control and reversibility. The first circuit is based on Yeast Two-hybrid System. The aggregation of Sup35 results in the binding of AD and BD, then downstream gene GFP expresses. In the second circuit, we split sfGFP, a variant of GFP, into two fragments: sfGFP1-10 and sfGFP11. sfGFP11 is linked to Sup35. sfGFP1-10 spontaneously binds to sfGFP11 to show green fluorescence, however, aggregation of Sup35 inhibits the binding, thus the fluorescence disappears. Being regulated by temperature and GDNHCL, our circuits can be used as biological temperature control kill switch, as biological temperature indicator and in scientific research.   "

We plan to use recombinant beta-glucosidase to modify ginsenosides to improve oral bioavailability.     We will take two separate approaches: in vitro enzymatic reaction and solid fermentation to test our beta-glucosidase activity toward ginsenosides modification.     We name our project iGUT for the purpose of emphasizing the importance of microorganisms of our gut in helping our nutrition and medicinal need, and would like to consider our recombinant beta-glucosidase containing E.coli as a model to develop new “probiotics-in-a-test-tube” for the modification of ginsenosides.

A large majority of these aldehydes are produced at low yield and over toxic catalysts. This gives rise to the need to produce these molecules in a renewable, environmentally friendly, and high-yield manner. Our project aims to meet these goals by developing a synthetic biology route to generate a library of aromatic aldehydes from their respective inexpensive toluene-based precursors that are an environmentally toxic waste in crude oil processing. We utilize the xyl ortho pathway of Pseudomonas putida, which is cloned into Escherichia coli as a host platform. This pathway converts toluene derivatives with a wide range of functional groups in the meta and para positions on the ring to their corresponding aromatic aldehydes, leaving the meta and para substituents unaltered and therefore allowing for development of a library of products.

In some cases, however, this point of view is not appropriate to describe lives. DNA sequences are not the sole factor which decides how an organism lives. Other factors are also able to control phenotype beyond generations. The purpose of our project is creating a genetic circuit functional in E. coli which allows E. coli to switch or loop back its gene expression and phenotype when each cell division takes place. This will be achieved by the use of the nrd promoter to sense to cell division, three types of sets of sigma factor/anti-sigma factor/sigma promoter control transcription orthogonally to make 3 states of gene expression, and a toehold switch to create an AND gate required in the circuit.

"Description": "The CounterEvolutionaries",
"Abstract": "The time has come for synthetic biology to free itself from the constraints of evolution. As an engineering discipline, synthetic biology depends on its genetically-encoded parts operating in consistent and predictable ways. Yet mutation and evolution break that predictability, altering the system’s behavior in disruptive or even dangerous ways, and selecting against intended transgene function. As long as evolution and mutation are allowed to proceed unchecked, the long-term stability, effectiveness, and safety of any genetic technology are at risk. Our solution began by characterizing a set of mutation-prone “hotspot” nucleotide sequences, which we then applied to create new algorithmic tools for modulating any gene’s susceptibility to mutation without affecting its function. With these tools we have achieved precise and predictable control over the frequency of mutation. Through rational design principles, our works shows that it is possible to counteract even the seemingly inescapable forces of evolution. Score one for engineering. "

"Abstract": "Phenylketonuria is a genetically inherited condition which is defined by the inability of a patient to break down an essential amino acid phenylalanine. Due to that, phenylalanine derivatives accumulate in the brain of a patient causing severe mental retardation. The aim of our team is to construct a bacterial probiotic with an enhanced rate of phenylalanine uptake and two independent systems for discharging phenylalanine. The first system will metabolize phenylalanine directly in the intestinal tract with phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) whilst the second system will incorporate excess phenylalanine into inclusion bodies made of synthetic phenylalnine-rich proteins. The production of these proteins is controlled by a postranscriptional regulator - a riboswitch, which is sensitive to phenylalanine. The final stage of the project will include verification of the system in a bacterial probiotic strain. "

"Abstract": "Synthetic biologists struggle to prevent the proliferation of genetically engineered organisms (GEOs) in natural systems. Containment methods that operate in ecological settings must provide security comparable to physical containment. Current methods fail to effectively inhibit horizontal gene transfer and environmental supplementation, and impose evolutionary pressure through the propagation of spontaneous revertants. Synthetic Translational Control (STC) currently utilizes a redesigned leucyl-tRNA synthetase and cleavage enzyme in an E. coli chassis to confer metabolic dependence on a synthetically modified leucine capable of conversion to L-leucine. Due to the semi-semantic property of this device, organisms cannot metabolically bypass our constraints using environmental supplementation and will display greater resistance to evolutionary escape relative to traditional synthetic auxotrophs. Our work provides advancement in biosafety by isolating GEOs from the environment via a reliance on modified metabolites. STC will become a benchmark for biocontainment devices and will allow for countless new applications in synthetic biology. "

"Abstract": "The abundance and diversity of our food relies on honeybee pollination. Varroa destructor mites weaken bee colonies through the spread of disease. Our team aims to save bees by killing Varroa using bacteria inside beehives. In continuous conversation with beekeepers and scientists we develop a bacterium that targets mites, leaving bees and humans unaffected. The hive-localized bacteria sense Varroa and produce mite-specific toxin, eliminating the need for beekeepers to dose the product. The bacteria are dependent on a synthetic amino acid and are shut down by light to confine them to the hive. Additionally, we develop an in vitro test of Varroa toxicity to show the utility of our bacterium. The system is modeled in various ways to assess its viability in the real world. This is the first effective method to combine specificity, ease of use, safety through bio-containment, and the iGEM open source character to save the honeybee.  "

"Abstract": "By providing fast and cheap diagnosis, the socio-economic impacts of disease can be reduced on a global scale. We aim to build an RNA based detection system utilising CRISPR/Cas9 technology, specifically targeting infectious agents. Using a dCas9 protein and an RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused to an effector, transcription of a fluorescent reporter gene can be regulated, with a significant colour change indicating the presence of targeted RNA. This is due to the conformational change that occurs within the gRNA strand when the targeted foreign RNA is recognised and binds. As a proof of principle, the sensor will be modified to detect two bacterial diseases: Lyme disease and Leptospirosis, and potentially two heavy metal pollutants: mercury and lead. The modularity of the system should allow simple modification to change sensor-specificity. Bacterial lysates will be detected by reconstituting the detection machinery in a low-cost in vitro transcription kit, including a paper-based support. "

Our project utilizes the violacein pathway to simulate other metabolic pathways with colored signals. By regulating gene expression in this gene set with two different inducible promoters, we are able to yield up to four different color outputs. These outputs are then measured by an open-sourced Raspberry Pi setup, which captures visual data via camera, measures the culture’s RGB value, and then directs the gradual release of inducer chemicals to maintain or change the culture’s color over time.

"Abstract": "The Nitrogen Project, of which this iGEM team is a part, seeks to drastically reduce the quantity of nitrogen-based fertilizers used in agriculture. Soluble nitrates can “runoff” into water systems with environmental consequences such as algal blooms and human illnesses like methemoglobinemia. If nitrogenase, the enzyme in soil bacteria that “fixes” nitrogen gas into usable nitrates, can be inserted into plants, it would eliminate the need for artificial fertilization. Before this can be done, nitrogenase must first be expressed non-diazotrophic bacteria like E. coli. For proper expression, however, E. coli must have an excess of intracellular ATP and reduced electron donors. We worked to overexpress glycolytic kinases to increase ATP production and overexpress native and foreign electron donors to produce more reduced electron donors. Besides nitrogenase, however, the intracellular environment of our “super cells” may help produce other recombinant proteins.   "

"Abstract": "Prions, or “zombie proteins,” are infectious agents that lead to a variety of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). They sicken cells by aggregating with each other and prevent proper protein folding leading to cell death from the accumulated damage. We propose a synthetic biology approach to better study prion propagation in the model organism S. cerevisiae. Our system involves inserting a premature stop codon into a protein open reading frame of interest or into dCas9 to respectively overexpress or knock-down protein levels during a [PSI+] response. We use Hsp104, a chaperone protein in S. cerevisiae, to demonstrate that our set-up phenotypically responds to the stop codon readthrough. This research is useful for continuously observing a phenotypic output during prion propagation in yeast and may have implications for helping to identify protein targets for both prevention and treatment of NDDs in the future.
